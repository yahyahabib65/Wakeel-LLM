This manual is the product of a collective effort by a number of
individuals and organisations, both local and international. As part of the
ambitious Women and Law in the Muslim World Programme undertaken
by the network Women Living Under Muslim Laws, the Pakistan Country
Project has been generously supported by the Heinrich Boll Foundation,
Germany; additional but equally vital support has come from NORAD
that is supporting part of the international coordination from Pakistan, as
well as from NOVIB (Holland), the Dutch Ministry for Foreign Affairs,
AIDAB,

CIDA, the Global Fund and MATCH

which have all sustained

other WLUML activities over the years, that have undoubtedly fed into
the current project.

The manual is based upon four working papers commissioned by Shirkat
Gah to analyse the trends in superior court case law since 1947 as part of
the Women & Law Pakistan Country Project:
‘An Analysis of the Trends of the Superior Courts in
Pakistan in Cases Relating to Marriage, Dower And
Divorce’, by Shaheen Sardar Ali and Rukhshanda
Naz;
“Trends of the Superior Courts of Pakistan in
Guardianship and Custody Cases (1947-92', by
Shaheen Sardar Ali and M. Nadeem Azam;

“Trends of the Superior Courts Regarding Succession

. Introduction to Handbook on Family Law
Given that the law is a living process, continually evolving and changing,
what is presented in this handbook can only be a snapshot of the law at
the time of writing; legal precedents may change - for the better or for the
worse. This handbook cannot therefore claim to be a definitive volume on
family law in Pakistan. What it does however hope to achieve is the filling
of a gap in material on the subject by providing lawyers and those
working for women's legal rights a detailed examination of family law
from the woman's perspective.|It highlights not (as is usually done) the
negative aspects of the law vis a vis women but the positive developments
which have led to improved protection of women's legal rights and the
strengthening of their position within the family. /
In the field of family law in Pakistan there are a number of contradictions
between
customary
practices',
established
Muslim
jurisprudence,
statutory law and the aspirations of the women of Pakistan.
There are, for example, conflicting opinions regarding the 1961 Muslim
Family Laws Ordinance. The conservative religious lobby attacks the
MFLO as being unlslamic', while women's legal aid groups comment that
the MFLO does not do enough to protect women's rights in family law.
Meanwhile the general public continues to disregard some of its protective
stipulations, such as the nikahnama clause 18 option of delegating the
right of divorce, due to customary practice.
These contradictions continue to give the courts wide scope in the
administration of justice and to make the task of lawyers taking on family
law cases more complex.

The purpose of this Handbook is to highlight the trends in superior court
case law in the area of family law, based on a study? of reported Pakistani
case law between 1947 and 1992 in cases where at least one party is
Muslim.

Out of over 700 cases that were initially found raising guardianship and
custody issues in the superior courts, over 260 were finally taken up for
analysis. Similarly, more than 1,000 cases concerning substantive issues
of dissolution of marriage, dower, maintenance, and divorce were found
and analysed. In contrast to the substantial body of reported cases in the
found
above areas, not more than 100 relevant reported cases were
covering matters eeconnected with succession and inheritance.

the law as well as in society.

Appendices, listing citations (and in the case of custody & guardianship

Wherever relevant, the Handbook quotes the text of the substantive law
and also comments on procedural matters. However, since the complex
and lengthy procedure in family cases is often a major factor in
discouraging women from approaching the courts, it was felt necessary to
include an additional Part on Procedure in Family Law (Part V). This
contains both case law on procedure and simplified charts of procedure for
the various suits involved in family cases. Apart from providing additional
details regarding procedure, this Part also includes the full text of
substantive laws relevant to family cases, as well as a sample nikahnama
and a sample certificate of divorce under S.7(8) of the Muslim Family

Laws Ordinance.

Law in the Muslim World Programme

1. THE NETWORK WOMEN LIVING UNDER MUSLIM LAWS
1.1 Introduction

Women Living Under Muslim Laws is a network of women whose lives
are shaped, conditioned or governed by laws, both written and unwritten,
drawn from interpretations of the Qur'an tied up with local traditions.
Generally speaking, men and the State use these against women,
they have done so under various political regimes.

and

Women Living Under Muslim Laws addresses itself to women living
where Islam is the religion of the State, as well as to women who belong
to Muslim communities ruled by minority religious laws; to women in
secular
states
where
Islam
is_ rapidly
expanding
and
where
fundamentalists demand a minority religious law; as well as to women
from immigrant Muslim communities in Europe and the Americas; and to
non-Muslim women, either nationals or foreigners, living in Muslim
countries and communities, where Muslim laws are applied to them and
to their children.

1.2 History of the network
Women Living Under Muslim Laws was formed in response to situations
which required urgent action during the years 1984-85. These included
the case of three feminists arrested and jailed without trial, kept
incommunicado for seven months, in Algeria, for having discussed with
other women the project of iaw known as the “Family Code', which was
highly unfavourable to women. Another was the case of an Indian Sunni

woman

who filed a petition in the Supreme

Court arguing that the

Muslim minority laws applied to her in her divorce denied
her the rights
otherwise guaranteed by the Constitution of India
to all citizens, and
called for support. Then there was the case of a woman
in Abu Dhabi
charged with adultery and sentenced to be stoned
to death after
delivering and feeding her child for two months.
Meanwhile the "Mothers
of Algiers" were fighting for custod

came together and formed the Action Committee of Women Livin
g Under
Muslim Laws, in support of women's struggles in the concerne
d contexts.
This Committee later evolved into the present network.

1.3 Objectives of WLUML
The objectives of the network Women Living Under Muslim Laws are:
to create links amongst women and women's groups
(including those prevented from organising or facing
repression if they attempt to do so) within Muslim
countries and communities;
*

.

to increase women's knowledge about both their
common and diverse situations in various contexts;

to strengthen their struggles and to create the
means to support them internationally from within
the Muslim world and outside.
In each of these countries till now women have been waging their struggle
in isolation.

Women Living Under Muslim Laws aims at:

.

:

Providing information for women and women's
groups from Muslim countries and communities;

disseminating this information to other women from
Muslim countries and communities;

:

*

supporting their struggles from within the Muslim
countries
and communities,
and making them
known outside;
providing

and women's groups based in the

Muslim world, who find that measures said to be Islamic (i.e., Muslim
laws'), are increasingly circumscribing their lives, and thus preventing
them from fully participating in, and benefiting from development
processes.

In the Muslim world and among Muslim communities, Islam operates
as
a way of life as much as a religion. It regulates the details of everyday life,
through written and unwritten codes which directly impact on people's
social, economic, political and personal responsibilities and rights. Thus
when dealing with Muslim laws, one is not only dealing with the legal
rights in the personal sphere, rather one is dealing with the relationship

of the individual with her or his immediate socio-economic and political
circumstances.

But these ‘laws' are not fixed. They are shaped by socio-economic and
political developments and involve a constantly changing selection of
customs, traditions, religious

Yet, women are normally unable to organize themselves to overcome
adverse laws/customs because they have erroneously been led to
believe
that the only existence possible for a Muslim woman
is the one outlined

for her in her own national context. Examples include
in parts of Africa
the practice of female genital mutilation which
is justified as being
ordained by Islam. In Pakistan among many
communities there is the
rigid application

of the practice of halala although the issue is
debated by
Muslim jurisprudence. Equally the Pathan
community asserts that its
customary code, the Pukhtunkhwa, is
formulated on the basis of the
principles of Islam.

Womome
en's powerlessness to challen ge the
interpretations
given to
principles governing their lives is the resu
lt of their isolatioan in specific
bs

environments, and their lack of knowledge about the codified laws as well
as the source of these laws.

There is therefore a need for women in the Muslim world to have access to
information regarding the laws both in their own countries/ecommunities
as well as access to wide interpretations of Islamic tenets reflected in the
diversity in the Muslim world. Access to this information in a form usable
at the grassroots is a means for empowering women to act locally.
The Women and Law Programme covers 26 countries throughout the
world, from Nigeria to Pakistan and from Tunisia to Fiji. It aims to
document and analyse the disparate and often contradictory laws (civil,
religious and customary) that govern the lives of women in the Muslim
world. It also seeks to outline the circumstances, forces and strategies
underlying both positive and negative trends regarding women's rights.
Beginning with country programmes in each of the participating
countries, the programme will move onto regional syntheses providing a
region-wide perspective, and will culminate at the international level with
a proposed Handbook on women in the Muslim world for use by human
rights organisations, women's organisations and individual women.

2.2 The Pakistan Country Project

1. INTRODUCTION
Prior to the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, the legal
system was a
conglomeration of customary practices, religious injunctions, and
statutes
of the Imperial Parliament.
Although since Independence there has been an attempt in Pakistan
to
codify and regulate established Muslim jurisprudence and customary
practices in the field of family law, the complex historical background
continues to have an impact on family law cases.
In order to comprehend the background to landmark decisions taken by
Pakistan's Superior Courts in the area of family law, the development of
family law needs to be traced over a much longer period, extending back
to (i arrival of Islam in the subcontinent and the later period of colonial
rule.

2. THE PERIOD OF MUSLIM RULE
Prior to its colonisation by the British, the Indian subcontinent had seen
centuries of Muslim rule. Muslim jurisprudence was introduced by
Muhammad bin Qasim soon after he conquered Sindh in 712 A.D. But it
was firmly established in India only from the end of the 12th century,
when the system of administrating justice through Qazis (with the help of
Muftis) as practised in other Muslim countries, was introduced!.
The Mughal Emperors took the administration of justice seriously, often
hearing cases themselves. It was during this period that institutions were
developed for deciding cases according to the Shariah (the single
exception was Emperor Akbar, who fancied himself a divine monarch and
created a new religion the Din-i-Ilahi). But the influence of the Mughal
institutions remained limited to Qasba towns?; imperial interests also

The history of the introduction, establishment and development of the legal system
during the seven centuries preceding the advent of British rule in India is a lengthy topic
not within the scope of this Handbook, which will largely confine its historical outline to
the British period (1857-1947). For details regarding the administration of justice in

demanded that the Mughal rulers tolerate communities
local institutions and practices that were against the Shariah’.

2.1 Diversity of cultures and customs

Before the arrival of the British, the Indian subcontinent had seen many
invasions and conquests, and the rise and fall of many civilisations. Over
the centuries it had sheltered people of vastly different cultures and
religions. Living in distant, self-contained tribal or clan communities, the
daily lives of its people were dominated by their own customs and usages
which were moulded by their own needs and circumstances. Such customs
and usages differed widely from community to community and place to
place. There were no customs prevalent throughout the subcontinent.

3. THE EARLY PERIOD OF BRITISH RULE
When the British first entered India through the agency of the East India
Company, they had two broad goals: first to extract economic surplus, in
the form of revenue, from the agrarian economy, and second,to maintain
effective political control with minimal military involvement.
During the earlier years the company was authorised by Charters? from
the Crown, the first of such Charters* authorised the Governor and
Company, to make laws and orders as were necessary for good

government of the company and that such laws and orders should be
reasonable and not repugnant to the laws of England. The Charter of
1622 authorised the company to chastise and correct all English persons
residing in East India and committing any misdemeanor. In 1661(5) the
Governor of the Council of the Company was empowered to try all persons
(including non-Europeans) in civil as well as criminal cases, living within
the Company's control.

4. THE ANGLICISATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
In the 18th century the Company Degan to combine mercantile pursuits
with military and political activities!. In 1726 the establishment of the
Mayor's Court in the three Presidency towns for the first time derived
authority and jurisdiction from the Crown under the Charter2.
After the battle of Plassey, and the grant of Dewani to Lord Clive by the
Mughal Emperor Shah Alam in 1765, the Company emerged as the
supreme political power in Bengal’. The Diwan authorised the collection
of provincial revenue and the administration of civil justice (but not
criminal justice)4. Local officials performed these functions under the
supervision of an English Resident. In 1772 the Company decided to
"stand forthwith as the Diwan" and assume direct responsibility itself.
The Warren Hastings Plan of 1772 established an hierarchy of civil and
criminal courts.

5. FAMILY LAW LEFT LARGELY UNTOUCHED
Although the courts established under the Hastings Plan followed British
procedure, they nevertheless applied ‘indigenous legal norms’ i.e.,
‘Mohammedan! law to Muslims, in matters regarding family law. The
Court also had Maulvis to advise it on established Muslim jurisprudence.
But in practice this proved of little effect as the administrators usually
did not interfere in the agrarian society?.
Thus despite the Anglicisation of the general legal system, certain aspects
like marriage, dower, divorce, maintenance and guardianship, gifts, wills
and wakfs were still governed by Muslim jurisprudence with only minor
modifications. The generally accepted reason for this approach was that
family law was viewed as a politically sensitive issue, interference in
which might have sparked off resistance thereby weakening colonial
power. But it must also be remembered that in colonial-era Britain itself,
women had few legal rights, especially in the area of family matters.

Today, when the West bemoans the degraded status of women in
Pakistani society, it would be pertinent to point out the colonisers own
negative role in the fossilization of Muslim family laws. By indulging in
selective ‘emancipation’ of the ‘natives', and conveniently overlooking
areas affecting women, the British colonisers dealt a heavy blow to
women's rights in the Indian subcontinent; customary law was allowed to
govern In areas particularly detrimental to women®.

began to focus on customs as a source of law? which led to a compilation

(or codification) of the local customs of various regions.
In the 19th century, after achieving a degree of stability in India, the
British made some efforts to provide ‘common law applicable to all classes
of the inhabitants of India with due regard to the feelings and usages
prevalent among them'?. Despite debating various suggestions* however,
the idea was not pursued During the 18th century, several laws had been
enacted which gave preference to customary Law over personal laws.

7. PROBLEMS WITH ENFORCEMENT OF CUSTOMARY LAWS
Enforcing customary laws had problems of its own, as customs differed
from tribe to tribe and place to place and were often unwritten. There
being no presumption in favour of a custom? it had to be found on
evidence by the person alleging it?. For a custom to be valid i.e. legally
enforceable, it had to be immemorial, reasonable and continuous‘ also not
contrary to the principles of ‘justice, equity and good conscience’ as well
as not declared void by any competent authority®. To establish whether a
particular custom was applicable or not was a lengthy, complicated and
time consuming process.

In addition to the question of political expediency, the colonisers' attempts
at codification in the field of personal law were also confounded by the
lack of consensus among the various schools of Muslim juristic thought.

9. THE POST-INDEPENDENCE PERIOD
The contradictions between customary practice, established Muslim
jurisprudence and statutory law have remained in the post-Independence
period. Certain enactments have perhaps even widened the gap; the 1948
Shariat Act, upholding women’s right to inherit agricultural land under
established Muslim jurisprudence, was a direct attack on customary
practice in Pakistan, while the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance overruled
the principle under Muslim jurisprudence that children of a predeceased
father cannot inherit from a grandfather. The MFLO is the only piece of
progressive legislation in the area of family laws. It gave affect to certain
recommendations of the Commission on Marriage and Family Laws 1955.
It has been objected to on many counts; by the clergy as being in

contravention to established Muslim jurisprudence, by the progressive
lobby as only a half-hearted effort to protect women's legal rights, but

generally because it was never placed before Parliament or discussed by
the elected representatives.
Meanwhile more recently, laws which have formed part of the process of
‘Islamisation' such as the Hudood Ordinances 1979, the Qanoon-iShahadat Act 1984 (Law of Evidence) and the Qisas and Diyat Ordinance
1991 have had a direct impact on the implementation and interpretation
of the law with regards to women.

In some

instances such as the non-

registration of marriage and divorce, these laws have contradicted
complicated the implementation of family laws.

or

The process of ‘Islamisation' shows that law continues to be closely
connected with political expediency. The result has been that since
Independence the use of legislation as a tool of social engineering,
particularly in the field of family law, has had both positive and negative
implications for women. With the country's political direction still
showing signs of instability, the future direction of change in family laws
in Pakistan is unclear.

1. INTRODUCTION
The issues relating to marriage, dower and divorce discussed in this
handbook are by no means exhaustive of the subject. They do however
emerge as the most litigated problems in family law, and the bulk of case
law is concentrated in these areas. In addition to this, the handbook also
highlights and analyses areas where reported case law is minimal, but
which are significant for women's legal rights. For example, one comes
across very few cases where a wife seeks divorce on the basis of tafweez
(delegated power of divorce). Similarly, there are only very rarely cases
where a woman invokes provisions of the law regulating polygamy to
demand a judicial decree for dissolution of her marriage.

2. OUTLINE OF LEGISLATION
Issues relating to marriage, dower and divorce are governed by a wide
range of laws. The following gives a brief description of some of the
relevant legislation and an overview of their historical background and
significance.

2.1 Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Acts
On attaining provincial autonomy in 1935 the NWFP Legislative
Assembly enacted the NWFP Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application
Act 1935. It became the first of a series of such Acts enacted with an
object to replace customs by Muslim personal law in certain specified
areas where the parties were Muslim.
Section 2 of the Act reads:

Decision in certain cases to be according to Muslim
Personal Law. In questions regarding succession,
special marriage property of females, betrothal,
divorce, dower, guardianship, minority, bastardy,
family relations, wills, legacies, gifts or any religious
usage or institution including Waaf (trust and trust

property), the rule of decision shall be the Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat), in cases where the parties

2.2 Child Marriages Restraint Act 1929 (Act XIX of 1929)
The aim of this piece of legislation is to restrain the solemnization of child
marriages and it falls in the category of laws which set legal norms rather
than expecting widespread application. It provides for punishment of
those (parents or guardians) who contract their minor children in
marriage. But keeping in view prevalent social norms and in the interests
of the minors themselves, marriages contracted in contravention of this
Act were not made invalid.

2.3 The Dissolution of Muslim Marri
arriages Act, 1939 (Act VIII of
1939) (DMMA)
Prior to this Act, Muslim women had no legal right of divorce while
customary practice denied them access to the doctrine of khula. To avoid

This is one the most important pieces of legislation promulgated in the
area of Muslim family law in the subcontinent. The preamble states that
its purpose is to:

consolidate and clarify the provisions of Muslim law
relating to suits for dissolution of marriage by
women married under Muslim law and to remove
doubts as to the effect of the renunciation of Islam
by a married Muslim woman on her marriage tie.
The Act codifies and regulates

Section 2(vii) of the DMMA also extends the option of puberty available to
a Muslim girl to repudiate her marriage if brought about while she was a
minor, to include a marriage contracted on her behalf by her father or
other guardian.
The DMMaA was subsequently amended twice by the Muslim Family Laws
Ordinance, 1961. These amendments provided the added ground for
dissolution where the husband took an additional wife without following
the procedure laid out in the MFLO, and allowed women to repudiate
marriages contracted by their guardians before they attained the age of
sixteen years, rather than fifteen years as originally provided for in the

DMMaA.

until five years later that some of its recommendations took the form of
the Muslim Family Law Ordinance, 1961.
The MFLO contained some important provisions that advanced women's
legal rights. For the first time the principles of talaq-i-ahsan and talaq-ihasan were incorporated into the law of the land and an effort was made
to regulate and formalise the process of divorce. Khula and the delegated
right of divorce for women were also recognised, the latter being
incorporated as an option in the standard nikahnama. Secondly,
polygamy was restricted in that a husband seeking a subsequent

amended the Child Marriages Restraint Act 1929, by raising the legal age
of marriage for females from 14 to 16 years!. The Ordinance also provided
security of inheritance for children of predeceased parents.
The MFLO has also been held to override not only all previous statute law
but also any law, custom or usage including Muslim personal law.

Implementation of the MFLO was facilitated through the Muslim Family
Laws Rules, 1961.

2.5 The West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 (West Pakistan Act
No. XXXV of 1964)
The last major piece of legislation in the area of family law, this Act was,
according to its preamble, designed to establish Family Courts ‘for the
expeditious settlement and disposal of disputes relating to marriage and family
affairs'. Under the Act, the matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the
Family Courts are: dissolution of marriage, dower, maintenance, restitution of
conjugal rights, custody of children, guardianship, and (added by a subsequent
amendment) jactitation of marriage.

1. MARRIAGE

1.1 Definition
"Nikkah or marriage implies a particular contract used for the purpose of
legalizing generation."! However, Baillie states, on authority from
Kifayah? that marriage is also instituted for the "solace of life" and is one
of the "prime or original necessities of man."3 Therefore, marriage
remains lawful even in extreme old age, after hope of offspring has ceased
or during marz-ul-maut (terminal illness).

1.2 Marriage is a contract
All major writers on Muslim jurisprudence agree that marriage according
to Islam is in the nature of a contract”; hence all the requisites of a valid
contract must be fulfilled.

1.3 Who can marry
The parties to the marriage contract must have capacity®. Every adult
Muslim of sound mind may enter into a valid contract of marriage’.

1.4 Witnesses, conditions, & necessity of consent
Marriage of a Muslim who is of sound mind and who has attained
puberty® is void if it is brought about without his/her consent9. There

but established Muslim jurisprudence states that a minor may be validly contracted into
marriage by his or her guardian. See Mannan, op. cit., pp.380-381.
Established Muslim jurisprudence (eg., Hedaya) states that "the earliest period of
puberty with respect to a boy is twelve years and with respect to a girl nine years. But
under statute law puberty is presumed, in the absence of evidence, on completion of
|
o
the age of fifteen years.
Even if a guardian has contracted a minor or a person of unsound mind into a valid
contract of marriage, ratification of the contract is essential when the minor attains
puberty or when the person of unsound mind regains sanity.

35

Marriage, Dower
& Divorce
must also be eejab o kabool i.e., proposal and acceptance at one meeting!.
The words with which the marriage is contracted must be clear and
unambiguous.
However, the requirement of witnesses is disputed. The traditional view
among jurists is that for the contract of marriage to be legally confirmed,
the presence of two male or one male and two female adult, sane, Muslim
witnesses is required’. It has been argued that a female may act as
witness to a marriage’, but that the presence of at least one male witness
is compulsory; according to this view therefore a marriage with only four
female witnesses would not be valid. Shafei differed on this point deeming
the testimony of females inadmissible except in cases relating to property.

Moreover, according to the recognised view, if cohabitation is continuous
and prolonged, the man and woman may be treated as husband and wife.
This presumption will also hold if the man acknowledges the woman as
his wife and/or the children born out of the union as legitimate.
According to Shia Law, the purpose of having witnesses is simply to
advertise the union and does not constitute an essential of the marriage
contract.

1.5 Valid, irregular and void marriages

muta may operate as a permanent marriage!.

There is no right of divorce in the case of muta. However, the husband
may at will put an end to the contract by a ‘gift of the term’ (hiba-imuddat) to the wife, even before the fixed term expires2. If the woman
leaves her husband before the expiry of the term, the husband is entitled
to deduct a proportionate part of the dower’.

1.5.3 Valid marriages: A valid marriage is one where all the requisites
have been fulfilled. Baillie describes a number of legal effects of such a
contract‘, For example, it legalizes the mutual enjoyment of the parties in
a manner permitted by law or according to nature®. It imposes on the
husband the obligation of mehr or dower, and of maintenance of his wife®.
It establishes on both sides the rights of inheritance and the prohibited
degrees of relationship’.
1.5.4 Void marriages: A void marriage is no marriage in the eyes of the
law8. It does not create any civil rights or obligations between the parties
and the offspring of such a marriage are illegitimate9. The obstacle in void
marriages is permanent and perpetual and cannot be remedied. Under
established Muslim jurisprudence, the following marriages are considered
void:

The bar to marriage in these instances is permanent and cannot be

1.5.5 Irregular marriages: An irregular (fasid) marriage is one that suffers

from a temporary bar or informality. An irregular marriage has no legal
effect before consummation and can be terminated by either party“, either
the marriage
or after consummation’.
Once

before
consummated, the wife becomes entitled to dower, she is bound to observe
iddat, and the issue of the marriage is legitimate*. An irregular marriage
however, does not create mutual rights of inheritance between husband
and wife°, nor does she have the right to maintenance. In certain

instances, once the temporary bar or
corrected, the marriage becomes valid

the following marriages are considered

Out of the list of irregular marriages given above, established Muslim
jurisprudence considers that only (i) cannot be rectified (a fresh marriage
contracted with witnesses would be required), although the point is
disputed, with some interpretations accepting that upon consummation
such a marriage becomes regular!. All others (ii)-(vi) can be rectified; (ii)
for example becomes valid on the termination of the woman's iddat period
while (iv) can be rectified by the woman's conversion to Islam or a
revealed religion.
1.5.6 Status of marriages between spouses of different religious faiths:
It is lawful for a Muslim male to marry not only a Muslim female but also
a Kitabia (follower of a revealed religion, eg., a Christian or a Jew). But if
he marries an idolatoress or a fire-worshipper (Zoroastrian), the marriage
would be irregular. However, according to Shia law, a Muslim male may
also lawfully marry a Zoroastrian.
Established Muslim jurisprudence states that a Muslim woman, on the
other hand, may only contract a valid marriage with a Muslim male. If
she marries a non-Muslim male even if he is a Kitabi, the marriage is
irregular. This point however, is controversial and is contested by some
interpretations, including those by feminist theologians. Baillie and the
Hedaya argue that since the bar is of a temporary nature therefore it is
correct to classify such marriages as irregular. But Fyzee regards them as
void.

1.6 Marriage contracted by guardian (jabar)
Although disputed by some, most writers of Muslim jurisprudence are of
the view that if certain relatives contract a minor in marriage, it is valid
and binding and cannot be repudiated by the minor on attaining puberty2.
1.6.1 Who holds right to contract marriage of a minor: This right belongs
successively to the father, paternal grandfather how highsoever, and
brother and other male relations in the order of inheritance enumerated
in the Table of Residuaries%. In default of paternal relations, the right
devolves upon the mother, maternal uncle or aunt and other maternal
relations within the prohibited degrees, and in default of maternal

kindred, the right devolves upon the ruling authority.

1.7 Option of puberty (khyar-ul-bulugh)

contracted on behalf of a minor by a guardian other than the father or

1.8 Polygamy
The only verse in the Qur'an dealing with polygamy states:
And if you fear that you cannot act equitably
towards orphans, then marry such women as seem

good to you, two, three and four, but if you fear that
you may not do justice to therm, then marry only one
or a captive that your right hand possess. That will
be more suitable to prevent you from doing

injustice’,

Under established Muslim jurisprudence, a Muslim male may lawfully
marry upto four wives at the same time*. However, the statute law in
various Muslim countries and communities has sought to regulate this
right, in some instances even outlawing the practice of polygamy.

In Pakistan, right from its inception, the MFLO has faced stiff opposition

both inside and outside the legislature on account of the conditions it
places on polygamy. Opponents of the MFLO contended that Islam
permits a man to be simultaneously married to up to four wives, and no
earthly power can revoke this privilege. Others contend that if the spirit
of Islam and its progressive stand on women's rights is taken into
account, this passage of the Qur'an only permits polygamy under certain
circumstances: it neither enjoins it nor even permits it unconditionally.

Others have argued that since the permission for polygamy arose out of
particular circumstances which may recur now and then, it is not right to
prohibit polygamy by legislation!; but equally that since the Qur'an has
made polygamy conditional on the just and equitable treatment of wives,
it is open to the state to prescribe conditions under which polygamy will
be allowable2.

2. JEHEZ
Jehez (dowry, trousseau) generally includes money, property, clothes,
jewellery and household effects given to the girl at the time of marriage by
her parents.

The practice is mostly cultural having little precedent in religion. Most
traditions (ahadith) and narratives on the life of the Prophet describe how
he gave only a few household goods to his daughter Fatima on her
marriage to Ali. The Prophet's son-in-law had to sell off his armour and
horse to set up house.

Nevertheless, among the Muslims of the subcontinent these traditions
have long been disregarded. Within Pakistan, cultural variations affect
the extent and manner of giving dowry. The practice is widely prevalent
in the Punjab; to a lesser extent in the Pukhtunkhwa and Baluchistan.
The extent of the practice within each community also depends upon
class.

3. DOWER
3.1 Definition
Dower is known by several names: mehr, sudak, nuhlah, and akr3,
Broadly Baillie defines dower as "the property which it is incumbent on a
husband [to give to the wife], either by reason of it being named in the

contract of marriage, or by virtue of the contract itself, as opposed to the

There are a variety of forms of dower described in detail below:

3.2 Proper Dower
Proper dower or mehr ul mis! is that which is due by the contract itself

and mehr ul mis! literally means “dower of the like’ or
equals. It is determined by the court in cases where dower
specified in the marriage contract after taking into account
other women belonging to the wife's family, such as sisters

3.3 Specified dower
Specified dower is one which is expressly mentioned
contract and is classified as either prompt or deferred.

in the marriage

3.3.1 Prompt dower: Is payable on demand and may also be demanded
before consummation of the marriage. Even after consummation has
taken place, the wife may refuse to live with the husband unless he pays
her prompt dower. This non-payment is regarded as a complete defence to
a suit for restitution of conjugal rights.

3.3.2 Deferred dower: Is payable on dissolution of the marriage by death
or divorce. After the husband's death, the wife is entitled to recover it
from his estate and if she is legally in possession of his estate, she may
retain it until her debt is paid off4.

3.4. Validity of marriages contracted without dower
3.4.1 Marriage valid even though no dower mentioned: While dower is
regarded as an essential element of the marriage contract, the
exact
implications and legal effects flowing from it remain controv
ersial.
It is argued that dower is not the exchange or considerat
ion given by the
man to the woman for entering into the contract®; "but
an effect of the
contract imposed on the husband as a token of respe
ct for the woman"®,

42

The marriage contract is valid even when no dower is mentioned,
even when it is expressly stipulated that there should be no dower'.

and

3.4.2 Dower an absolute right even if not specified in contract: It is
argued however, in response to the view mentioned in 3.4.1 above, that
mehr or dower is that financial gain which the wife is entitled to receive
from her husband by virtue of the marriage contract itself whether named
or not in the contract of marriage®. Dower therefore is a right which
comes into existence with the marriage contract itself and is its integral

component.

3.4.3 Wife may remit dower: The wife may remit the dower or any part of
it in favour of her husband or his heirs, even if the remission is made

without consideration.

4. DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE
Under Muslim jurisprudence the contract of marriage is automatically
dissolved on the death of one of the parties and may be dissolved in their
lifetimes by divorce.
Divorce can take several different forms and no particular form is
prescribed or assigned a superior legal status./Generally speaking, the
forms of divorce under Muslim jurisprudence can be divided into two
categories: one which involves a unilateral initiative by either spouse; and
the other which involves mutual consent. |

4.1 Definition of talaq
The prerogative of the Muslim male to unilaterally terminate the
marriage contract irrevocably without assigning any cause is known as
talaq*. Three modes of pronouncing talaq are recognised by the various
schools of Muslim jurisprudence:

Talaq-i-ahsan (talaq-e-salasa): A single pronouncement of divorce
(i)
made during a tuhr or period between menstruations, followed by
abstinence from sexual intercourse for the period of iddat.
Talaq-i-hasan: Three pronouncements of divorce during three
(ii)
successive tuhrs, no intercourse taking place during any of the tuhrs.

ibid, p.44.

Mannan, op. cit., p.402.

OND Mannan, op. cit., p.418.

43

Marriage, Dower
& Divorce
Talaq-i-bidat: Three pronouncements of divorce either in one
(iii)
sentence or three separate sentences, one a single occasion. The intention

to pronounce an irrevocable divorce must be present.

4.2 Talaq-i-tafweez
Since marriage is a civil contract, a restraining stipulation to the affect
that this right of the husband may be delegated to the wife, may be
inserted’. In addition to the wife, this delegated right of divorce may also

be given to a third person either conditionally or absolutely and either
permanently or for a temporary period.

4.3 Dissolution by mutual consent (mubarat)
Occurs when the aversion is mutual./The main difference between khula
and mubarat is that in the former the wife is bound to give a
consideration to the husband for release from the marital tie whereas in
mubarat the spouses mutually agree to terminate the marriage contract
and the wife may or may not give anything to the husband in exchange. /
Mubarat can be conditional or unconditional.
In mubarat, the wife has to observe iddat and the husband is bound to
maintain her during this period.

4.4 Khula
4.4.1 Khula defined: Writers on established Muslim jurisprudence define
khula as meaning "to put off, as a man is said to khula his garment when
he puts it off... In law it is laying down by a husband of his right and
authority over his wife for an exchange."3

Khula occurs when the aversion is on the side of the wife and she takes
the initiative in the dissolution of the marriage by agreeing to
forego her
dower and/or other material benefits given by the husban
d./The

Qura'nic
basis for the doctrine of khula is derived from Surah Al-Baqra,
Verse 229:

ee

her freedom. These are the limits ordained by Allah;
so do not transgress them; if any do transgress the
limits ordained by Allah, such persons wrong
(themselves as well as others)!.

4.4.2 Khula not a unilateral right: Thus although khula is the wife's right,
it is a right that she may not exercise unilaterally in the manner in which
the husband could pronounce talaq.

/ The right of khula under traditional law seems to be placed on a weaker
footing than talaq by the husband since talaq may operate independently
of the wife's consent while in khula the consent of the husband must be
taken. But in Pakistani case law since the landmark case of Khurshid
Bibi vs. Muhammad

Amin, consent of the husband is no longer held as a

condition precedent to the operation of a khula. There, it was argued on
the strength of cases decided by the Prophet, that the only condition for
effecting a khula was the willingness of the wife to return the material
benefits given to her by the husband at the time of marriage.”

4.4.3 Role of the court: If khula is concluded by the mutual agreement of
the spouses it may be effected without the court's interference. But if the
husband does not consent, then it is the judge who, if he is convinced of
the wife's case, may order the dissolution of the marriage.
4.4.4 Khula and iddat: As in mubarat, the wife has to observe iddat.

4.5 Other forms of dissolution of marriage
4.5.1 lla, zihar, and lian: Recognised under Muslim jurisprudence but
rarely used are, ila, zihar, and lian. In all the three modes, the wife is
entitled to move the court (Qazi) for a dissolution of the marriage.
Tla occurs when a husband abstains from sexual intercourse with his wife
for a period of at least 4 months, pursuant to a vow. In zihar the husband

compares his wife to his mother or another female with whom he may not
lawfully contract a marriage. Lian, literally “mutual cursing’ or
imprecation, is when the husband accuses his wife of adultery through a
sworn testimony, where the only evidence is his own testimony and where
the wife through an identical sworn testimony denies such a charge.

Following such an event the wife is entitled to seek dissolution of the

marriage. The Qur'anic source for lian is Surah Al-Nur (24), Verses 6-

10(°).

akistan, this principle has been complicated by the passage of the
Seudecd (Offence of Zina) Ordinance 1979, and the Offence of Qazf
Ordinance 1979, which in theory would make the wife liable to
prosecution by the state for zina (adultery) and the husband, if the
charges are not proved against her, liable for qazf (false accusation). In
practice, the matter has been even more complicated, as demonstrated by
case law.

4.5.2. Apostasy: Apostasy, or the rejection of one's original faith, can also
lead to the dissolution of marriage. According to the principles of
established Muslim jurisprudence, if for example the wife converts to
Islam in a country where Islam is the law of the land, her marriage will
stand automatically dissolved and she will not have to undergo a period of
iddat.

4.5.3 Other grounds on which wife can approach qazi for dissolution:
Established Muslim jurisprudence accepts a number of other grounds
including the husband's impotence, prolonged insanity or imprisonment,
and his failure to perform marital obligations or maintain his wife.
Desertion is also accepted as a grounds for dissolution when the
whereabouts of the husband have not been known for four years'.

4.6 Procedure for talaq, mubarat & khula
Talaq under Sunni law may be given either orally or in writing and a man
is not required to give any kind of written notice to his wife if he wants to
divorce her.

However, under Shia law it is incumbent on the husband to pronounce the
divorce orally in the presence and hearing of two competent witnesses. A
written divorce is ineffective and not recognised unless the husband is
physically incapable of an oral pronouncement.
The procedure for khula involves the wife making a verbal declaration
before the court, while mubarat also involves a verbal
statement made
between the parties.

5. IDDAT
Iddat is the period followin g dissolutio
n of marriage either by death or
divorce during which it is incumben
t upon a woman not to contract
another marriage.

cane

However a distinction must be drawn between the iddat to be observed on
divorce or dissolution of marriage, and that which is observed following
the death of the husband, although in both instances where the wife is
pregnant iddat will terminate on delivery or the expiry of the set iddat
period, whichever is later.
5.1 Iddat and divorce
The Qur'anic source for the principle of iddat in case of divorce is Surah
Al-Baqara (2), Verse 228, which says.

Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves
for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them
to hide what Allah hath created in their wombs.

5.2 Iddat on husband's death
In the case of widows, Surah Al-Baqara (2), Verse 234 states
...they shall wait concerning themselves four months
and ten days: when they have fulfilled their term,
there is no blame on you if they dispose of
themselves in a just and reasonable manner.

Established Muslim jurisprudence states that if the woman is not
menstruating, the measurement of time is to be in lunar months.
However there appears to be some confusion over the established period
of iddat for widows who are no longer menstruating, with some
authorities insisting on four lunar months and ten days, and others
insisting iddat need only be three lunar months.

5.3 Iddat and consummation
If the marriage is dissolved by divorce, the wife is bound to observe iddat
only if there was consummation; where the marriage remained
unconsummated, she is free to re-marry immediately without observing
iddat. However in the event of the husband's death, the widow is bound to
observe iddat whether the marriage was consummated or not.

5.4 Calculation of iddat's commencement
Calculation of iddat begins from the date of divorce or husband's death.
However, where the information regarding divorce or husband's death
does not reach the wife until after the expiry of the iddat period, she is not

bound to observe any iddat’.

6. MAINTENANCE
6.1 Maintenance during marriage
The established principle is that the male is ‘the provider’, largely drawn
from the traditional translation/interpretation of Surah Al-Nissa (4):
Verse 34 which begins:

Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,
because Allah has given the one more (strength)
than the other, and because they support them from
their means...
6.2 Maintenance after divorce or death of husband
While the courts in Pakistan have ruled that the wife is to be allowed
post-divorce maintenance during iddat, the Qur'an provides no such time
limitation. Surah Al-Bagra (2): Verse 241 states “For divorced women
maintenance (should be provided) on a reasonable (scale)...' For widows,

traditional interpretations of the Surah Al-Bagqra (2): Verse 240 provide
for one year's maintenance although alternative interpretations have
argued for a more generous interpretation.

1. VALIDITY AND STATUS OF MARRIAGES
1.1 Marriages between Muslims of different sects
A Sunni woman marrying a Shia does not become a Shia; the law to be
observed in the trial of suits shall, in the absence of any enactment or
usage having the force of law, be the personal law of the defendant, and in
the absence of any specific law and usage, the rule of justice, equity and

good conscience shall apply!.

1.2 Application of MFLO to marriages between Muslims and nonMuslims
The MFLO applies to all Muslim citizens of Pakistan wherever they may
be and will even cover marriages, for example, between a Pakistani
Muslim male and a non-Muslim female if recognised as valid by the laws
of Pakistan. Muslim Law also applies irrespective of where the marriage

is contracted.

Since Qadianis were declared non-Muslims in 1974 the

1.3 Status of marriages between Muslims and followers of other

faiths

1.3.1 Muslim females: According to the principles of established Muslim
jurisprudence marriage of a Muslim female with a non-Muslim male is
void. However, feminist theologians have disputed this point and assert
that a Muslim woman may indeed marry a Kitabia male. While such
marriages have occurred, few such couples are known to reside in
Pakistan.

The matter of jurisdiction has been raised regarding the case of a suit for
dissolution of marriage between a Muslim wife and non-Muslim, Ahle
Kitab husband. It was held that since under Hanafi law such a marriage

_& Divorce

was void from the very date of contract, creating no rights between the
parties, the Family Court had the jurisdiction to annul the marriage
under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act!.
1.3.2 Husband's attempt to evade maintenance demand rejected: In a
maintenance suit2, the husband as a defence to the wife's demand for
maintenance, took the plea that he is an Ahmedi and therefore under the
Constitution (2nd Amendment) Act XLIX of 1974, a non-Muslim. This
makes his marriage with a Muslim woman (his wife) void under
traditional interpretations of Muslim jurisprudence. The court did not
take up the issue of the validity of this marriage. Instead, it ruled that the
husband's plea came at a very late stage and this defence could not be
upheld. The learned judge was of the opinion that since the couple were
married in 1958 according to Muslim Sunni Hanafi law, therefore the
same law will apply.

1.3.3 Muslim males: Marriages between Muslim males and Kitabia
females? are allowed under Muslim jurisprudence and Pakistan statute
law, and, invariably contracted through a nikahnama, fall within the
purview of Muslim personal law and the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance.
However, marriages between Muslim males and non-Kitabia females* are
irregular with consequent implications for the rights of the parties.

1.4 Status of marriages involving Qadianis
When Qadianis were declared non-Muslims in 1974, serious questions
arose as to the status of the marriages between Muslim males and
Qadiani women and between Muslim women and Qadiani men.

Three cases involving Ahmedis/Qadianis are reported in 1986 but a
survey of 1947-1992 superior court case law found there has not been one
case that deals directly with the status of marriages to Qadianis; it seems

the courts prefer to avoid the issue.
1.4.1 Muslim Family Laws Ordinance held to apply: In one case involving
Qadianis®, the validity of a talaq pronounced by the husband under
the
MFLO was at issue. The talaq was held effective after the
expiry of 3

months, once again without going into the details of why a law
supposedly

appucable only to Muslims should form the basis of a decision
between
citizens

who have been declared non-Muslims under the Constit
ution.

as they were Qadianis without going into the issue of what law would be
applicable to these marriages.

1.5 Status of unregistered marriages
S.5 of the MFLO provides for the registration of all marriages solemnised
under Muslim law, whether solemnised by the Nikah Registrar or anyone
else. One Nikah Registrar in each Ward is licensed by the Union Council
= supply the standard nikahnama forms on payment of the prescribed
ee.
While at the time of its enactment, this Section of the MFLO was
regarded as a significant victory for women, notably securing their right
to inherit from deceased husbands, a substantial number of marriages
continue to remain unwritten and unregistered.

1.5.1 Interaction with Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance: Until
the 1980s, there was little case law on the validity of an unregistered
marriage or at least the problems associated with unregistered marriages
were fewer.
However, after the promulgation of the Zina (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance 1979, there appears to have been an increase in case law on
the status of unregistered/unwritten marriages as an adjunct to zina
cases. Thus, S.5 of the MFLO which was originally intended to protect
women's rights has become a tool in the hands of those who seek to
deprive them of their happiness. This problem is discussed in further
detail in 9.3 and 9.5 below relating to the non-notification of divorce.
1.5.2 Oral/Unregistered marriage is valid: While there is no legal
provision for accepting unregistered marriages, in various precedents the
courts have held that an oral and/or unregistered marriage is valid! and
have upheld S.5(4) as providing for a simple punishment of contravention
of this Section of the MFLO. In one case2, it was held that there is no

need for any formal instrument of marriage.
Thus in one zina case it was held that a nikah can be performed orally
and the marriage is not invalidated by contravention of S.5(4)°.
1.5.3 Non-registration not to make marriage void: As in many other areas
of family law, on the issue of non-registration of marriage the courts
appear to insist on deciding each case on its own merits. Rather than
regarding non-registration as the conclusive proof of the non-existence of
a marriage, other circumstances have also been given due importance.

Marriage, Dower
& Divorce
Thus it has been held that ‘Where the factum of marriage was in serious
doubt between parties, non-registration might cause some doubt on its
existence and solemnisation.'!

1.6 Other forms of marriage
1.6.1 Muta marriage: Although not recognised as a valid marriage under
statute law, within the Shia community muta marriage is still
occasionally found. Case law regarding the rights of the parties to a muta
marriage appears to date exclusively from the pre-Independence period
(See Section B, 1.5.2 above).

1.6.2 Civil marriage: The Special Marriage Act, 1872, which provides for a
civil marriage for a couple of differing faiths is not open to Muslims, who
are automatically governed by the MFLO (See 1.2 above).

1.7 Court's obligation to consider nikahnama
It has been held that the family courts have acted illegally and not in
accordance with the law when they have ignored the basic document of
marriage, the nikahnama, or when they have not given full effect to the
terms contained in the document?.

2. DOWER (mehr)
2.1 Definition
Apart from the traditional definitions outlined in Section B: 3.
above, the
courts have also ruled on what does not constitute
dower.

Thus it has been held that various amounts paid by the
husband to the
wife during the marriage should not be presumed to
be in lieu of dower’.

2.3 Transfer of property in lieu of dower
Entry into the nikahnama of the transfer of property in lieu of dower is
proof enough of the transfer without the transfer requiring any formal
registration to this effect by the husband. On the basis of this entry, the
wife can claim the property.
However, the husband cannot modify an agreement regarding the
transfer of property in lieu of dower without the express consent of the
wife!, which means written and witnessed consent.

2.4 Dower may be in cash or kind
The dower of a wife may be in cash or in kind or it may be in the form of
rendition of personal service. Where ornaments and clothes were
admittedly given to the bride against her dower amount, the courts have
rejected a subsequent plea from the wife that ornaments and clothes
given to her at the time of marriage were not adjustable against her
dower amount?.

2.5 Dower not within jurisdiction of Union Council
Decisions in the matter of dower do not lie within the jurisdiction of the
Union Council’. All suits regarding dower are to be filed before the
Family Courts. Therefore any order by a Chairman Arbitration Council
decreeing payment of dower is without jurisdiction and any action taken
by the Revenue Authorities to recover the dower amount on such an order

is without lawful authority‘.
2.6 Prompt dower

consummation has taken place, the wife may refuse to live with her
husband unless he pays her prompt dower®. This non-payment is
regarded as a complete defence to a suit for restitution of conjugal rights
and in this case, it was held that the wife is competent to refuse herself to
her husband.

Consummation is presumed to have taken place -- and therefore
husband is liable to pay the full dower -- if the man and woman are ever
together in ‘complete retirement’ (privacy)!.
The following commentary accompanies the Limitation Act 1908, Sch. 1
Article 103 which relates to prompt (exigible/mu'ajjal) dower:It is not necessary that a wife may sue for prompt dower. An heir or
tranferee will be entitled to use for recovery of the dower and will for the

purpose of limitation, stand in the shoes of the wife. If at the time of

marriage, the wife was under 16 years of age, and if the father as the
guardian entered into a contract on the infant's behalf, the right to dower
can be enforced by the minor. Similarly, if the contract of dower was
entered into after the marriage on behalf of the minor husband, it is
binding on the husband.

Where the husband dies without payment of the dower debt, the wife is
entitled to claim the dower debt from the legal representatives of the
husband to the extent of his assets in their hands. F, a Muslim, put his
wife in possession of his property in order that she might satisfy her
dower therefrom, and then F died and his heirs wrongfully took
possession of his property. In a suit for the recovery of the balance of the
dower debt, the three year limitation period (see 2.11 below) ran from the
date of dispossession and not from the date of the husband's death. In
consideration of a dower debt, a martgage deed was executed by the
husband in favour of his wife. A suit to recover such mortgage debt was
held not to be governed by this article.
Regarding divorce and prompt dower, the commentary noted that the
period of limitation begins to run from the date of divorce. Thus were the
parties governed by the Hanafi Muslim school of law and there was a first
divorce by a written document and its contents were known to the wife
but the couple subsequently lived together as husband and wife and then
again there was a divorce by talaq, a suit by the wife for prompt dower
brought more than three years after the first divorce was barred. When
talaq is communicated to the wife after it is pronounced, limitation
for a
suit under this Article will begin to run from the date it is
communicated
to the wife. When the husband divorced his wife in her
absence by talaq
and the Qazi informed the wife of it on a later

time began to run from the later date.

2.8 Dower and divorce
2.8.1 Mehr ul misl: A woman can claim dower upon divorce even if none
had been fixed initially. This holds true even, for example, where a
Muslim male and Christian female have a Registry marriage abroad!.
2.8.2 Dower following apostasy: While there have been rulings in foreign
courts that a woman is entitled to her whole dower upon divorce even if
the divorce is on account of her apostasy2, this is so far not the case in
Pakistan.

2.9 Dower recovered after death of husband
2.9.1 Land as dower: Titles to land given as dower and dated to coincide
with the registration of her marriage have been held as valid’. The
recovery of this dower is not to be postponed until the attestation of

mutation‘.

2.9.2 Property in lieu of dower: Oral agreements gifting property in lieu
of dower are not held as valid. However where there has been no specific
agreement at the time of nikah transferring property to the wife as dower,
the widow can nevertheless realise her deferred dower debt from the
income of the deceased husband's property.

In contrast, it has also been held that the widow can only realise dower

lifetime or his heirs consent to her possession®.

2.10 Remission of dower
It has been held that where a woman remits her dower either under
mental stress in the period following her husband's death’, or during his
lifetime to gain/retain his favour, she is not acting as a free agent. Such a
decision is not one made with free consent and is therefore not binding on

2.11 Time limit for recovery of dower
The period of limitation for a suit to recover prompt dower is accepted as 3

years from the date of demand and refusal, or, where no demand has been
made during the continuance of the marriage, on dissolution of the
marriage by death or divorce,

Similarly, the period of limitation for a suit to recover deferred dower is
accepted as 3 years from the date when the marriage is dissolved by death
or divorce.
‘
Article 103 of the Limitation Act, 1908, which governs the limitations on
suits for recovery of dower provides two conditions: that the demand has

been made and that the husband has refused to pay the dower. Unless
these two conditions have been fulfilled, the period of limitation will not

start running’.

2.12 No presumption in favour of payment
It has been held that the lapse of time since marriage and/or the
husband's ability to pay the dower debt raises no presumption in favour of

payment?.

2.13 Burden of proof on husband regarding payment
The courts have ruled that it is for the husband to prove that dower has

indeed been paid®. The nikahnama is accepted as the main evidence,
especially where oral evidence is contradictory, that dower was never

given in suits for recovery of deferred dower.

Section 8 of the MFLO reads:

Where the right to divorce has been duly delegated
to the wife and she wishes to exercise that right, or
where any of the parties to a marriage wishes to
dissolve the marriage otherwise than by talaq, the
provisions of section 7 shall, mutatis mutandis and
so far as applicable, apply.

3.1 Comparison of talaq and khula
A feature of Pakistani case law in the field of dissolution of marriage has
been the debate over the parallels and comparisons between talaq and
khula, essentially between the rights of a man and of a woman to divorce.
Conclusions have not been decisive and the debate continues to evolve in
case law.
In the landmark decision of the Supreme Court in the Khurshid Bibi case,
Justice S. A. Mahmood stated that khula is so characteristically different
from talaq that the two cannot be equated!. Talaq is to be unilaterally
pronounced by the husband without being required to assign any cause.
Khula is given at the instance of the wife only when the spouses cannot

live harmoniously2.
Whatever legal obstacles the law may place in front of a
a divorce, ultimately the courts. can only delay but

3.2 Grounds for dissolution through khula
A study of reported Pakistani case law suggests that the superior courts
have upheld the traditional interpretation of the doctrine of khula,
namely that it is not an absolute right of the wife but a controlled one’,
In order to exercise the right of khula, a wife has to prove a fixed aversion

for her husband and convince the court that she is incapable of living with
him "within the limits prescribed by Allah"4, in other words that an

irretrievable breakdown of marriage has taken place, at least insofar as
the wife is concerned.

The Khurshid Bibi case’, established the doctrine of khula as the right of

the wife on proof that she could no longer live in a reasonably congenial
atmosphere with her husband in the following words:
"The Holy Qur'an declares in Verse 2:228 that
women have rights against men similar to those that
men have against them. It conferred the right of
khula on women as against the right of talaq in men.
On the one hand, it put fetters on the unbridled
exercise of power of divorce by the husband by
providing for appointment of arbiters in Verse 35,
Chapter IV, in case of breach between the spouses,
and on the other, conferred a right on women to seek
dissolution of their marriage before the Qazi, the
success of the right depending upon his order. The
trend of Qur'anic legislation is clearly in favour of
freeing of the wife, where the marriage tie cannot
serve the objects of marriage, namely, sukun,
moaddat and rehmat (peace of mind, love, kindness,
sympathy and compassion) specified in Verse 21,
Chapter XXX of the Holy Qur'an. If its objects
cannot be served by a marriage, should it continue,
though it be purposeless and even harmful, or is it
not better that it be dissolved, so that the evil
consequence of an impossible relationship are
avoided?"2

3.3 Husband's consent not a condition
A further principle that emerged from the decision in the Khurshid Bibi
case was that the consent of the husband is not a condition precedent to
the termination of the marriage contract3. This principle has bee n upheld

and the trend is fairly stable4

Court on Khula’,Ld in Vol.IV, No.4 January
1985, Journal of Law

appeal for khula was to be dismissed because hatred on the part of the
wife for the husband is not a valid ground for divorce under Muslim law
unless the husband agrees to it.
In later cases judges have exercised their own discretion as to what
constituted extreme hatred, dislike, etc. These have included mental

torture as a grounds for khula!.

3.4.1 Narrower interpretation: It has been held that khula was not to be

allowed on the mere asking of the wife2. The existence of an irremediable

breach between the parties, making it impossible for her to perform her
part of the contract within the limits prescribed by God, had to be proved
by wife to the satisfaction of the judicial conscience of the court3. Equally
the courts have judged that where the object of levelling allegations
against the husband was to get a divorce from him and since these
=e ie ye were not proved, the courts below rightly refused the wife
ula*,

3.4.2 Broader interpretation: “In apparent contrast to the stricter
enforcements of the condition of irretrievable breakdown discussed in
3.4.1 above, it has been held that the wife can claim khula as of right, the
only limitation being where it was sought for immoral purposes”.
Similarly, in another case®, it was stated that the right of a woman to
obtain khula on her offer to return all the benefits received by her from
her husband is almost akin to the right of a man to pronounce talaq on his
wife without assigning any cause.

3.5 Evidence required to prove grounds for khula
3.5.1 Not necessary for woman to show extent of hatred: It has been
held that the failure of the wife to mention the extent of her hatred is not
fatal to her plea of khula’. The court observed: "aversion of the wife for
her husband might emanate from causes not very substantial but
considering the personal nature of the relationship between the parties,
the courts were more concerned with her state of mind than with the
basis thereof"®.

3.5.2 No time limit: The courts have ruled that no time limit can be set
within which the development of hatred can be accepted as a grounds for
khula!.

3.5.3 Failure to prove grounds does not invalidate suit for khula:
Similarly, even if a woman fails to prove various issues in a suit for khula

this does not necessarily mean the admitted rift between the parties was

without cause?. The effect of this judgement is that the mere fact that the
woman is seeking dissolution means the marital relationship has broken
down irretrievably. Similarly in another case%, the trial court rejected a
woman's allegation that her husband had had illicit relations with his
brother's wife as grounds for khula. The appellate court, however, found
that such an allegation, even if not proved, was an indication of such
strained relations that the spouses could not live together within the
limits prescribed by Allah.

In a recent judgement, the court held that the wife does not need to come
out with logical, objective and sufficient reasons regarding her claim for
khula, adding that the parties were the best judge as to whether they
could live together amicably4.
3.5.4 Difference between insufficient evidence and no evidence: It has
been held that there is a difference between insufficient evidence and the

total lack of evidence while proving the husband's cruelty as grounds for
khula; where there was insufficient evidence, the khula has nevertheless
been upheld as valid.

3.5.5 Status of wife's evidence: A wife's testimony regarding the grounds
for khula, while not taken as sufficient evidence alone, is sufficient as part

of the general circumstances®. Her deposition plus the failure of
reconciliation efforts is sufficient evidence in a suit for khula’.
3.5.6 Personal attendance before Family Court not indispensible:
This is
a provision particularly important for women who strictly observ

before the

and evidence by affidavit is acceptable.

judgement*, it was held that the 1984 Evidence Act (Qanun-e-Shahdat) is
applicable to proceedings before a Family Court.
3.6 Khula and halala
A khula by agreement of both spouses was held to fall under S.8 of the

MFLO and was not revokable®.

But it has been held that if a marriage stands dissolved by khula and the
parties wish to remarry, they may do so without an intervening marriage

(halala)®.

3.7 Compensation to be paid by wife in khula (zar-i-khula)
‘Zar' in the broad sense means wealth’. In the present context, it implies
the material benefits that a wife has to return
consideration of her release from the marital tie.

to her

husband

in

In khula, the wife has to actually “buy' her freedom from the husband.
Ordinarily the wife agrees to forego her dower and/or return to the
husband other material benefits received from him, though an agreement
to pay something else is also valid. The exact calculation of the amount
each individual woman has to pay for her freedom from the marriage
varies considerably. The court may even order the wife to pay only a
small, symbolic sum.
3.7.1 Benefits received by husband to be taken into account: It has been
argued that while ordering restitution of benefits received by wife, the
courts must take into consideration the reciprocal benefits received by the

husband. In one case’, the court was of the view that continuous living
together, bearing and rearing children, house-keeping, etc. could also be
counted as benefits received by the husband, thereby off-setting the
benefits that the wife had to return in order to secure her khula.

3.7.3 Ornaments not counted as benefits received: It has been held that
ornaments the wife takes away when leaving the home do not count as
benefits received by the woman2.
Similarly, the wife is not liable to return jewellery as a consideration for
khula’.
,

3.7.4 Onus to prove benefits lies on husband: It is for the husband to
prove his claim regarding the benefits received by the wife during their
marriage*. The courts require material and/or documentary proof of
benefits received by the wife from the husband during the marriage; a
simple oral claim is not regarded as sufficient in zar-i-khula claims”.

3.7.5 Courts have discretion to calculate zar-i-khula: The court in its
discretion can either order complete or partial restoration of benefits or
not at all depending upon the circumstances of each case, where the court
will consider as to which of the spouses was at fault®. In many orders
granting khula where it was felt that the husband was at fault, the wife
was allowed to pay a minimal sum as the price of the her freedom’.
3.7.6 Zar-i-khula not obligatory: In cases where the husband had failed to
make a specific demand for zar-i-khula either in his written statement
during the case or in court, the wife could not be directed to pay
compensation. In such circumstances, imposition of a condition regarding
= relinquishment of dower and maintenance was declared of no legal

A decree for restitution of conjugal rights passed in favour of the husband

phenomenon would give fresh cause of action to the wife on each day. The
wife would be entitled to khula as of right if she had satisfied the court
that rejection of her suit would mean forcing her into a hateful union.

“Marriage, Dower
| & Divorce
3.11 Appeal against lower court decisions in khula
In general, a decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of khula is
not appealable!. However, the High Court has the jurisdiction to interfere
in Family Court and District Court judgements regarding khula if it is
convinced the case so demands?. Where the High Court has insisted it has
the jurisdiction to interfere, it has often used this right to the woman's
benefit.

Ruling on the validity of the trial court's dismissal of a suit for dissolution
on the basis of khula, a recent judgement held the trial court's refusal as
illegal and not in accordance with the evidence on record as relations
between the spouses were so strained that it was not possible for them to
live within the limits prescribed by Allah. The case was remanded to the

trial court for a fresh decision.
There are also examples of cases in which the High Court has refused to
interfere where petitioner-husbands have sought reversal of Family Court
rulings granting judicial divorce on the grounds of cruelty and failure to
provide maintenance’.

In another case, the court held that the intention of barring an appeal
against a decree for dissolution of marriage by the Family Court is not to
reopen and agitate issues based on factual material in the appellate
forum. The husband cannot be permitted to achieve this objective
indirectly by having recourse to invoking writ jurisdiction9.

It has been held that there is no bar under S.14(2) of the Family Courts
Act 1964 on a wife appealing against the conditions imposed by a Family
Court while dissolving her marriage on the grounds of khula®.

4. DELEGATED RIGHT OF DIVORCE (talaq-i-tafweez)
4.1 Definition
Although unilateral dissolution of the marriage contract by talaq
is the
husband's prerogative under Muslim jurisprudence, this right
may also be
delegated to the wife or to a third person conditionally or
unconditionally
The resultant dissolution would be a talaq by tafweez.

4.2 Incorporated into nikahnama form
This principle of Muslim jurisprudence has been recognized and
incorporated into S.8 of the MFLO. It has also been incorporated in the

standard nikahnama form!.

Clause 18 of the nikahnama asks:

Whether the husband has delegated the power of
divorce to the wife. If so, under what conditions...

Despite its inclusion in the standard nikahnama form, customary practice
dictates that clause 18 and the option of talaq-i-tafweez are invariably
struck out at the time of signing; a 1992 case study in three Peshawar
localities revealed only two nikahnamas where clause 18 had not been
crossed out. It is also not clear whether failure to strike out clause 18
brings the presumption that talaq-i-tafweez has indeed been granted.
From 1947 to date not more than a dozen cases have been reported where
the wife has obtained a release from the marriage contract on the basis of
talaq by tafweez. Moreover, most of these cases were reported in the pre1947 period and early post-independence years despite the absence of
legislation regulating this practice.

4.3 Courts uphold delegated right of divorce
The courts have held as illegal a Union Council Chairman's refusal to
take cognizance of a notice of talaq sent by a woman having the delegated
power of divorce in her nikahnama2. This right was upheld even though
the woman in this case was a Christian while her husband was a Muslim.

4.4 Unconditional talaq-i-tafweez upheld
In one case which went through various: stages of appeal, it was finally
held that the unconditional delegation of the power of talaq is ‘not

illegal's.

4.5 Conditional talaq-i-tafweez
The courts have decided conditional talaq-i-tafweez cases on the merits of
each case. Thus in one instance, the wife was granted the power of talaq-i-

tafweez in the event that the husband either failed to pay prompt dower
or failed to maintain her. The court accepted the wife's claim that both
conditions had been fulfilled and that therefore she had the right to talaq-

and
i-tafweez. The husband's appeal against the judgement was dismissed

In another case, however, in which the wife's right to talaq-i-tafweez was
conditional upon the husband's failure to maintain her for two years, the
court held that if the wife is to blame for the failure of maintenance (i.e.,
she leaves him and refuses all his attempts to bring her back to the
marital home), she has no right to claim talaq-i-tafweez¢.

5. DIVORCE BY MUTUAL

AGREEMENT (mubarat)

It has been held that divorce by mubarat falls under S.8 of the MFLO%.
5.1 Mubarat is irrevocable
Talaq by mutual agreement is in the nature of mubarat; mubarat is
irrevocable from the date of execution and the provisions of S.7 of the
MFLO allowing for revocation do not apply4. This observation came in a
case which involved a watta satta marriage in which both unions were
mutually dissolved following strained relations. The court's ruling
rejected an attempt to question the status of one of the women's second
marriage and bring her under the purview of the Zina Ordinance.

9.2 Requirement of notice to Union Council in mubarat
In mubarat the divorce remains valid even if only one partner provides
notice of the divorce to the Chairman Union Council and the other
partner subsequently denies talaq took place?.

Analysis of
6.1 Grounds for divorce under DMMA
The DMMA, under a concept completély distinct from khula, provides
Muslim women the possibility of judicial divorce on the following grounds:
(i)
that the whereabouts of the husband have not been known for a
period of four years;

(ii)

that the husband has neglected or has failed to provide for her
maintenance for a period of two years;

[Gi-a)

that the husband has taken an additional wife in contravention of

the provisions of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961:]'
(iii) | that the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period
of seven years or upwards;
(iv)

that the husband has failed to perform, without reasonable cause,
his marital obligations for a period of three years;

(v)

that the husband was impotent at the time of the marriage and
continues to be so;

(vi)

| that the husband has been insane for a period of two years or is
suffering from leprosy or a virulent venereal disease;

(vii)

that she, having been given in marriage by her father or other
guardian before she attained the age of [sixteen?] years,

repudiated the marriage before attaining the age of eighteen years:

While in the bulk of reported case law the wife has demanded termination
of the marriage on the grounds of cruelty and/or non-maintenance by the
husband, in the majority of these cases the women have only succeeded in

achieving a dissolution through khula and foregoing their dower. Only a
tiny minority of cases reviewed successfully used S.2(ii) or S.2(viii) of the
DMMaA, entitling the wife not only to a divorce but also to her dower and
to maintenance during the period of iddat.
6.2 Non-Maintenance
In a number of cases the courts have upheld the wife's right to seek
dissolution on the grounds of non-maintenance under S.2(ii) of the

DMMA' and have accepted proof of neglect for two
independent grounds for dissolution under the DMMA2.

years

as

an

In one case%, the court observed that although it had rejected four out of
the five grounds cited by the woman as grounds for dissolution, the fact
that one ground (non-maintenance) had been found in her favour was
sufficient to grant her dissolution.

6.2.1 Definition of ‘two years': The courts have defined the “two years'
mentioned in S.2(ii) of the DMMA as a single, unbroken period and
not

several periods amounting to two years’. Equally, the two years
must
immediately precede the suit for dissolution on this grounds;
two years of
non-maintenance followed by a period when maintenance
was provided,
followed again by a period of neglect preceding the
suit are not accepted

as grounds for dissolution under non-maintenance).

6.2.2 Definition of ‘neglect’: Neglect implies the
husband's willful failure
to maintain his wife§,

6.2.3 Reasons for non-maintenance immaterial: However, it has also
been held that in non-maintenance cases it is immaterial whether the
failure to maintain the wife was due to poverty, failing, health, loss of
work, imprisonment, or any other cause}.

6.2.4 Husband has to prove maintenance: It is for the husband to provide
reliable evidence that his wife left the home of her own accord and that
she refused his efforts to bring her back2, i.e., that non-maintenance was
a consequence of her own actions.

6.3 Cruelty
6.3.1 Mental cruelty falls within purview of S.2(viii): The courts have
upheld the principle outlined in S.2(viii)(a) that mental cruelty is a
grounds for dissolution under the DMMA3,/V erbal abuse is taken to be a
form of cruelty and cruelty can be construed from a single incident. /
‘Habitual disagreement with the wife's decisions done without rhyme or
reason and just in order to make her life miserable is regarded as cruelty,
even in the absence of physical violence’.

The levelling of false charges in writing against the wife's character also

constitutes cruelty°.
6.3.2 Husband's social superiority does not license cruelty: While the
courts have accepted the fact that in a Muslim marriage, the husband
enjoys superiority, they have insisted that this does not give him
authority to trouble his wife without reason, nor does it help him avoid
the legal consequences of maltreatment of his wife.
The courts have also rejected the husband's plea that his wife's
disobedience invited his wrath where there is clearly no evidence to

support his claim’.

6.4 Misappropriation of property
The

courts

have

upheld

the

principle

outlined

in S.2(viii)(d)

that

misappropriation of the wife's property is a grounds for dissolution under
the DMMA and in such circumstances have even quashed a lower court
order for khula, instead granting dissolution under the DMMA®.

bad character

Similarly, the husband's bad character has been accepted as a grounds for

dissolution under S.2(viii)(b) of the DMMA, and the courts have accepted
the wife's plea, overturning a lower court order for khula’.

6.6 Ila, zihar, lian
There are a small number of cases falling under this category which have
been reported in case law2. In such circumstances, the wife is able to
approach the court to grant dissolution of her marriage under S.2(ix) of
the DMMA.
6.6.1 Lian cases since 1979: The lian form of dissolution of marriage has,
however, been greatly complicated by the Zina Ordinance and the Offence
Qazf Ordinance of 1979 (S.14). Where lian in the past simply involved
mutual cursing and the matter ended with the end of the marriage, the
accusation of zina and retort of qazf now bring further charges in their
wake. In one 1983 case? which appeared before the Federal Shariat
Court, the husband was acquitted of the charge of qazf, but the question
remained of whether the wife was then liable to zina. Under S.14(4) of the
Offence of Qazf, 1979 a wife who accepts the husband's accusation as true
shall be awarded Hadd punishment.
The four learned judges were deeply divided on the question and
forwarded various conflicting arguments from Hanafi and Shafei
doctrines. One judge was of the opinion that if tazir was proved against
the wife (in the case that the State automatically registered against her
following the husband's accusation of zina), she remains liable to
punishment. Another judge was of the opinion that since in lian the
woman had already invoked the curse of Allah upon herself if she be
lying, no worldly court has the right to debate punishment to her as
Allah's punishment is the ultimate punishment.
In a later case4, it was held that it was the husband's and not the wife's
burden to prove her guilt/innocence of the charge. The courts have also
shown that they do not take lian lightly and have insisted that
any
subsequent withdrawal of the charge by the husband must
be genuine
and honest, a full recantation of the charge and not
just a simple
statement that the charge has been withdrawn’.

6.7 Apostasy
Similarly, apostasy -- conversion or rejection of one's existing faith
by
either party -- is taken as a grounds for dissolution of a marriage under
S.2(ix) of the DMMA! (See Section A: 2.3 above and Section C: 2.5:2
above). This holds true even if the conversion is to a revealed religion,
such as in a case where a Muslim woman converted to Christianity2.

6.8 Desertion and cruelty
The pleas of desertion and cruelty as grounds for dissolution under the
DMMA are not mutually exclusive. The courts have held that a husband
can cause mental torture during separation through means such as
leer te calls or letters, or may physically attack the wife outside the
ome”.

6.9 Other grounds under DMMA
6.9.1 Polygamy: (See 8.3 below on polygamy as a grounds for divorce)
6.9.2 Little case law: There is virtually no case law on the dissolution of
marriages under other provisions of the DMMA relating, for example, to
absence, imprisonment or insanity of husband. There are, however,
isolated precedents for dissolution on the grounds of failure to perform
marital obligations* and impotence’.

6.10 Iddat following dissolution under judicial decree
The period
the Family
under S.7
parties can

of 90 days starts from the date the certified talaq was sent by
Court to the Chairman. There is no need for additional notice
and no need for a further 90 days waiting period before the
remarry°®.

6.11 Evidence required under DMMA
6.11.1 Evidence of close relatives admissible: It has been held that the
evidence of the wife's father and brother is not inadmissible. In one case’,
the judge observed: "I am not in agreement with the argument that two
male witnesses or one male and two female witnesses are required to
prove a matter under Shariah. That a contrary view is held by at least

three schools of thought would also prove against this principle being
binding on the courts. The sum and substance of this discussion is that
neither the evidence of the father nor of the brother is inadmissible
although it may not be found safe in some cases to rely upon it."
6.11.2 Evidence of the wife sufficient: The same case also held that it is
not necessary for a particular number of witnesses to prove a cause; if the
evidence of the woman is strong enough it alone is sufficient’.
6.11.3 Evidence of husband necessary: In cruelty cases, the courts must
take the husband's evidence into account?.

6.11.4 Wife's failure to give evidence: The wife's failure to appear and
give evidence in a suit for dissolution under the DMMA and the
subsequent dismissal of the suit does not act as a bar to her filing a fresh
suit,
6.12 Combined suit for khula and dissolution under DMMA
In one case4, a woman sought dissolution on the grounds of cruelty and
misappropriation of dower as well as on the grounds of khula. By adding
the grounds of khula, it was held that she waived her right to recover
dower not yet paid.

However, in another case the higher courts upheld the decision of the
lower courts to grant a suit for dissolution on the grounds of nonmaintenance while rejecting the grounds of cruelty and khula®. Thus a
combined plea for dissolution of marriage under the DMMA and under
khula may not always be detrimental to a woman's rights.

or he
prevented her from exercising her legal rights over it, i.e., the grounds
laid out in S.2(viii)(d) of the DMMA!.

6.13.3 Instances where appeal against decree not possible: Under
S.14(2)(a) a decree for dissolution of marriage under the DMMaA is not
appealable where the dissolution was effected on the following grounds:
that the husband has failed to pay maintenance to the wife; that he failed
to perform marital obligations without any just excuse; and that he
treated the wife with habitual cruelty by beating her2. Similarly a decree
for dissolution is not appealable where the grounds were as cited in S.2(ii)
& (iv) and deprived his wife of her ornaments and misappropriated them’,
6.13.4 Appeal against dismissal of suit under DMMA possible: There is
no bar under S.14(2)(a) on an appeal against the dismissal of a suit for
dissolution of marriage’.
6.14 Procedural matters
It has been upheld that a decree of the Family Court for the dissolution of
a marriage solemnised under the MFLO and communicated to the
Chairman of the Union Council carries the same weight as a talaq as

outlined in S.7 of the MFLO9.

6.14.1 Requirement of notification of dissolution: An earlier ruling® that
a wife must independently inform the Chairman of the Union Council
about a divorce through judicial decree and must also send formal notice
to her husband has since been overruled. The courts have upheld that the
Family Court is obliged to send within seven days by registered post a
copy of the judicial decree to the Chairman of the Union Council,
whereupon the Chairman proceeds as if he had received a notification of
talaq under S.7 of the MFLO’. In other. words, since the woman has no
unilateral right of divorce and has to approach the courts for grant of
dissolution

of marriage,

the woman

also need not take any individual

action regarding procedural matters.
6.14.2 Principle of res judicata not applicable: Subsequent suits for the

dissolution of marriage on an independent cause of action are not hit by

the principle of res judicata®.

This section of the DMMA has been upheld by the courts, even in relation
to marriages contracted by the girl's father’.

However, the courts in the past have sought to underline that the DMMA
merely clarifies and does not change Muslim personal law. It has been
observed that "the option of puberty of Muhammadan Law is only a right
given toa minor party to a contract to avoid the contract entered into by
her guardian on becoming sui juris.’ As the preamble shows, the

Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939, does not purport to effect any
change in Muhammadan Law but to clarify and consolidate it."2

7.3 Pubert woman can contract marriage of own choice
The courts in certain instances! have declared that when a girl is pubert,
she may exercise the option of puberty not only when she seeks
dissolution of her marriage but also when she wishes to contract a
marriage -- with or without her parents/guardian's consent; effectively,
she can insist she is pubert and therefore according to Muslim
jurisprudence mature enough to enter into a union of her own choice.

7.4 Age at which option can be exercised
The DMMA sought to regulate the option of puberty by requiring the
minor girl to exercise the option between the age of 16 years and 18 years.
Basic case law in this area has upheld the DMMA's provisions.
But that is not to say that a girl who has attained puberty earlier than 15
years cannot exercise the option. For instance on interpreting S.2(vii) of
the DMMA regarding its scope, one court favoured a wide meaning rather
than construing it in the narrow sense%. The courts have observed that
under Muslim jurisprudence, repudiation of marriage in exercise of the
option of puberty is still available where the age of puberty was earlier
than = years, provided the woman can prove puberty was before 16 years
of age*.
7.5 Courts tend to rule in woman's favour
Case law in this area is fairly stable and where it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that all ingredients of exercising option of puberty
are present®, the courts have tended to rule in the woman's favour® (See

These ingredients are: that the marriage was not consummated; that it was contracted

before the girl was 16; that she repudiates the marriage before the age of 18.

Section C: 14. regarding custody of

child-wife).

7.6 Contradiction between DMMA and legal age of majority
Reported case law has mostly had to deal with cases where the girl
wanted to get out of an undesirable union. The courts have used the age of
majority accepted under Muslim jurisprudence which is on the onset of
menstruation and which is invariably lower than the age of majority
under the law of the land (eighteen).

But in an unusual decision in Sajjad Hussain vs. Superintendent Darul
Aman Multan! a distinction:was drawn between age of puberty (which
may be 15 years or less) and age of discretion (which the court held to be
18 years). In this case, the girl was pubert according to Muslim
jurisprudence, sui juris and thus capable of making her own decision
regarding whom she wanted to marry. But the court awarded custody to
her parents saying that until she reached the age of discretion, her
parents would hold custody. This appears to contradict 7.4 above.
Clearly there is a need for greater clarity in deciding the scope and extent
of the right of option of puberty granted to a Muslim girl under the
DMMaA.

8. POLYGAMY
According to established Muslim jurisprudence, a Muslim male may
lawfully marry upto four wives at the same time. However, in Pakistan

the husband's right has been made subject to certain conditions-- but not

prohibited -- by S.6 of the MFLO. Under this Section, the husband has
to
apply in writing to the Chairman Arbitration Council stating the reasons
for the proposed additional marriage? and also stating whether
the
consent of the existing wife/wives has been obtained. The Chairman
then

calls a meeting of the parties or their representatives and
has to be
satisfied that the proposed marriage is ‘necessary’. However,
the wife's
refusal to consent will not prevent the subsequent marriage
. If the
husband fails to obtain the Arbitration Council's
permission for a
subsequent marriage, he is liable to be punished
- but only if the wife

recoverable as arrears of land revenue; and on
conviction upon complaint be punishable with simple
imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with
fine which may extend to Rs. 5,000, or with both.

8.1 Subsequent marriages contracted in contravention of S.6
MFLO remain valid
There are very few reported cases where a complaint has been made
against the husband
for contracting a subsequent marriage in
contravention of the MFLO. In three cases, the husband was said to have
entered into a subsequent marriage without seeking prior permission
from his existing wife and hence the subsequent marriage should be

declared void and illegal.
One appellant pleaded that since her husband's second marriage had
neither been registered under the MFLO nor had she granted him the
required permission, the subsequent marriage was therefore not valid.
The court, however ruled that it has not been laid down anywhere in the
MFLO that a marriage which is not registered under S.5 or which was
contracted in contravention of S.6 would be invalid?. Thus it was held
that, although in contravention of S.6, such polygamous marriages are
valid’, strengthening the argument that the MFLO fails to act as an
effective deterrent to polygamy.

8.2 Necessary ingredients for offence under S.6 MFLO
It has been held that the
provisions of the MFLO
and existing wife/wives;
Arbitration Council and

necessary ingredients for an offence under the
regulating polygamy are: a previous marriage
the absence of requisite permission from the
the celebration of a marriage in violation of

S.6(4).

8.3 Divorce under interaction of provisions of MFLO relating to
polygamy and DMMA
In 1961, contravention of the provisions of the MFLO regulating
polygamy were incorporated in the DMMA as giving the wife a further
ground for judicial divorce.
Section 2(ii-a) of the DMMA reads:
That the husband has taken any additional wife in
contravention of the provisions of the Muslim Family
Laws Ordinance, 1961;

There is very little reported. case law regarding instances where the
husband's remarriage has been directly invoked in obtaining the
dissolution of marriage. One example is Nadir Khan vs. Zeenat Bibi,
discussed immediately below.

In the 30 years of case law following the promulgation of the MFLO,
S.2(ii-a) of the DMMA has been invoked in about half a dozen cases! and
has invariably been invoked in conjunction with S.2(vili-f) which includes
as an example of cruelty the husband's failure to treat his wives equitably
in accordance with the injunctions of the Qur'an.
~—

In one case? the court granted dissolution of marriage on the ground that
the husband had contracted a second marriage without the consent of the
wife, strictly upholding the provisions of S.2(ii-a) of the DMMA./

In an earlier case, the High Court upheld the Appellate Court's decision
that there was unrebutted evidence on file and granted her dissolution
under the DMMA, overturning the Family Court's rejection of her suit3.
8.3.1 Onus of proof of consent on husband: In cases falling under S.2(iia), the onus of proof that the husband had indeed obtained the wife's
permission for a subsequent marriage is on the husband and where he
fails to prove this, there are grounds for dissolution under the DMMA4.

8.4 Husband's failure to treat wives equitably

Under S.2(viii)(f) of the DMMA, the wife is entitled to
dissolution of
marriage if in a polygamous union, the husband
fails to treat her
equitably in accordance with the injunctions
of the Qur'an. There is
extremely little case law in this area.

a wife living in a polygamous union is entitled to separate living quarters
and maintenance, and that failure to make such provisions is a grounds
for dissolution under the DMMA\.

8.5 Subsequent wife can be ‘aggrieved party' under S.6
It has been held that the MFLO also offers protection to subsequent
wife/wives against a husband who fails to disclose his existing marriages
and obtain permission from the Arbitration Council for a subsequent
marriage®. In such circumstances a second wife may file a case as an
aggrieved person under S.6 of the MFLO.

8.6 Foreign marriage does not enforce monogamy
A marriage contracted abroad under a format other than the nikahnama
does not enforce monogamy on Pakistani Muslim males. The courts have
rejected the wife's plea that her marriage contracted under British law in
the UK obliged her husband to remain monogamous, and upheld his right

as under the MFLO to have up to four wives?3.

8.7 Procedural matters
8.7.1 Union Council of wife's residence empowered to grant permission:
Only the Union Council of the existing wife's residence is empowered to
set up an Arbitration Council which could grant permission for polygamy
under Ss.3 and 6. The husband is not permitted to secure permission from
the Arbitration Council from his Union Council area.

8.7.2 Private party not authorised to initiate proceedings: It has been
held that a private person is not authorised to initiate proceedings on the
accusation of polygamy in contravention of S.6 MFLO on behalf of the

Union Council Chairman‘.
8.7.3 Jurisdiction in offence of bigamy: Where a husband contracts a
second or subsequent marriage during the subsistence of his existing

marriage(s), the existing wife/wives has to present her complaint to the
Union Council concerned. The Union Council is then to file a complaint of
bigamy to the Magistrate concerned. Neither the Family Judge, nor the
Chairman of the Arbitration Council has jurisdiction to take cognizance of

such complaints?.

9. TALAQ: SECTION 7, MUSLIM FAMILY LAWS ORDINANCE, 1961

9.1 Objectives of Section

7 MFLO

Through codification and institutionalisation of Muslim personal law on
divorce, the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance sought to provide women a
bare minimum of protection from the effects of a unilateral, instantaneous
and unwritten talaq, whereby women often find themselves divorced and
ejected from their homes overnight without the cushioning period of iddat
and its guarantee of maintenance, without recourse to reconciliation and
no protection against repeated verbal declarations of talaq./
This basic protection
certain procedure for
Contravention of this
simple imprisonment

is achiéved by requiring the husband to follow a
talaq, which also involves the local authorities.
procedure makes him liable to the punishment of
up to a year and/or fine which may extend to

Rs.5000.

Firstly, S.7(1) ensures a written notice of talaq is provided to the Union
Council Chairman with a copy to the wife, making very clear the
termination of the marriage/ Second and most importantly, S.7 seeks to
do away with the instantaneous talaq-i-bidat and to institutionalise talaqi-ahsan and talaq-i-hasan/ (for definitions see Section B: 4.1 above), and to
poe a 90-day gap between the pronouncement of divorce and its taking
effect.

Section 7(3) of the MFLO reads:
Save as provided in sub-section (5), talaq unless
revoked earlier, expressly or otherwise, shall not be
effective until the expiration of 90 days from the day
on which notice under sub-section (1) is delivered to
the Chairman.

Thirdly, under S.7(4) the parties are also required to
appear before an Arbitration Council to attempt
reconciliation. And fourthly, S.7(6) minimises the
requirement of an intervening marriage by the
woman (halala) in cases where former spouses wish
to remarry.

Section 7(6) of the MFLO reads:
Nothing shall debar a wife whose marriage
has been
terminated by talaq effective under this
section from
remarrying

intervening marriage

with a third person,

unless

such termination is for the 3rd time so effective.

9.2 MFLO implies talaq-i-ahsan is accepted form
S.7(1) of the MFLO stipulates procedure after “the pronouncement of
talaq in any form' and does not specify which of the different types of
talaq elaborated by the various schools of Muslim jurisprudence: talaq-iahsan, talaq-i-hasan, talaq-i-bidat. However, S.7(3)'s requirement of a
waiting period of 90 days before the finalisation of the divorce, implies
that the MFLO accepts only a talaq-i-ahsan.

It has therefore been held that there is no need for three separate notices
of divorce on three successive tuhrs and the procedure outlined in S.7 has
been upheld!.
9.3 Interaction between the MFLO and Hudood Ordinances
Faulty drafting of the provisions of the MFLO in general and those of S.7
in particular has meant the provisions concerning divorce have lent
themselves to widely varying interpretations.
This situation became particularly problematic for women following the
passage of the Hudood Ordinances in 1979 and other “Islamisation'
legislation? which had an undoubtable impact on the implementation of

the MFLO.
Prior to the Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, in most cases
relating to the non-registration of talaq the courts held that the woman
was still married. The courts acted on the belief that the MFLO's objective
was to protect women from the effects of arbitrary divorce; therefore

registration of divorce and the subsequent wait of 90 days was one of the
limitations imposed upon the husband's unilateral and arbitrary right to
pronounce talaq.

With the coming into force of the Zina Ordinance, the MFLO's insistence
that only notified talaqs would become effective appeared as a
disadvantage to women. Its effects became clear when vindictive former
husbands who had not sent notice of talaq to the Union Council, alleged
that their former wife, who after being given a talaq had remarried, was

guilty of adultery®.

_ Marriage, Dower
| & Divorce

After many legal battles, the courts finally declared that failure to notify
did not invalidate the talaq itself. In a landmark judgment', Justice
Naseem Hassan Shah held that "where a wife bonafide believing that her
previous marriage with her former husband stands dissolved on the basis
of a talaqnama although the husband has not got it registered with the
Union Council enters into a second marriage, neither this second
marriage nor the fact of her living with the second husband will amount
to Zina because of her bonafide belief that her first marriage stood
dissolved."
While in such instances the courts have attempted to save women from
the disastrous interaction of-the MFLO and Hudood Ordinances, in the
process the protection the MFLO offered women against arbitrary and
unregistered talaq has largely been lost.

9.4 Contradictory rulings regarding Islamic' nature of MFLO S.7
Although the MFLO has long been the subject of controversy, in recent
years, following the process of “Islamisation', there have been a number of
often contradictory rulings on whether the MFLO is repugnant to Islam.
The controversy has been particularly heated in relation to Section 7.
It is important to note that rulings regarding the MFLO's repugnancy
have often been based on the immediate demands of a particular case and
cannot be used as a blanket legal precedent to uphold women's rights in
subsequent cases where the circumstances may be different.

Thus the courts have ruled the MFLO was not repugnant to Islam2.
However, in other instances3, the courts have declared that the
ineffectiveness of talaq in the absence of a notice to the Chairman as
envisaged in S.7 is against the injunctions of Islam. This view was
subsequently affirmed by the Shariat Appellate Bench’.

9.5 Case law on validity of talaq in absence of notice
\ Unlike Muslim jurisprudence, which upholds an oral pronouncement of
divorce, Section 7(1) of the MFLO requires that as soon as the husba
nd
pronounces talaq he must provide written notice of divorce
to the

9.5.1 Absence of notice invalidates divorce: At times, the courts have
put a strict construction to S.7 of the MFLO and held that where no notice
of talaq was served upon the Chairman, talaq does not become effective

unless and until 90 days expire after the service of notice to the
Chairman. For instance, in the famous case of Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi vs.

Lt. Col. Muhammad

Yusuf! it was held that a notice of talaq by the

husband is mandatory without which a divorce is not valid.
In a more recent case, a similar ruling was given although the important
addition of ‘corroborating other evidence' was made. Here it was held that
non-service of notice of talaq under S.7 would be a material circumstance,
corroborating other evidence on record, in support of the fact that
factually no talaq was given by the husband.

9.5.2 Talaq effective despite absence of notice: In another case it has
been held that talaq would be effective even though absence of notice to
the Union Council Chairman constituted a violation of S.7 of the MFLO
and was punishable’. This would seem to contradict the case law cited in
9.5.1 above.

It has also been held that failure to send a copy of the talaq to the
Chairman Union Council within the prescribed seven days does not affect
the validity of the divorce*. A similar ruling that notice of talaq to the
Chairman was not necessary was made in a case where the parties were

Qadianis°.

9.5.3 Absence of notice immaterial to when divorce becomes effective:
In a more recent judgement completely contradicting that noted in 9.4.1
above, it was held that failure to supply a copy of the talaq notice is not
material to when the talaq becomes effective. The talaq will be operative

90 days after it is pronounced and the Chairman of the Union Council has

no power to annul a divorce on the allegation that the husband failed to
supply a copy to his former wife,
In another case, where the wife remarried following her divorce (and

faced zina charges), the court again ruled that her second marriage

remains valid if contracted after 90 days even where her first husband
failed to provide written notice to the Chairman Union Council’,
9.5.4 Talaq not dependent upon order from local authorities: It has been
held that the effectiveness of talaq is not dependent upon the passing of
any order by the Union Council Chairman or the District Commissioner.

9.5.5 Failure to provide notice is procedural; does not affect fact of
dissolution: The general trend is that failure to give notice of talag to the
Union Council Chairman and not submitting to arbitration is a matter
that is procedural in nature and does not affect the substantive issue,
namely the fact of dissolution of marriage.
9.5.6 Entry on register is no proof of divorce: A simple entry on the
Union Council register made at the behest of some unidentified person is
not accepted as proof of divorce in the absence of other witnesses or any
formal deed of divorce’.

9.6 Absence of arbitration does not affect validity of divorce
Divorce is effective after 90 days even if an Arbitration Council, as
provided for in S.7(4) MFLO, is never constituted4 or even if the spouses
themselves are not present at the reconciliation meetings®.

9.7 Revocation of talaq
Talaq can be revoked under S.7 of the MFLO within 90 days of
pronouncement and the provision of notice to the wife®.
If the husband fails to provide notice of talaq and also lodges a suit for
restitution of conjugal rights within the 90 day period, the woman
is no
longer divorced’.

9.7.1 Status of marriage where written notice of talaq
provided but
marital relations later resume: In a complex case of
this nature, a
husband issued a notice of talaq and the Chairman
subsequently issued
the couple a certificate of talaq. However, the husba
nd later claimed he
and his wife continued to live together and a
son was born; the wife
meanwhile claimed she was abducted and raped
by her former husband.

9.8 Shia law and talag under S.7 of MFLO
S.7 of the MFLO requiring written notification of a divorce finds itself in
contradiction to Shia law, giving rise to some interesting case law. In
general the courts have upheld principles of Shia personal law with a few
modifications.

9.8.1 Written divorce ineffective (Shia): For Shias, a written divorce is
one case, both husband and wife were
ineffective and not recognised2.In
Shia, and the husband divorced his wife through a divorce deed witnessed
by two witnesses. A copy was sent to the Chairman Union Council who
declared the divorce duly effective after the passage of 90 days. Following
the wife's challenge regarding the validity of this divorce, it was held that
the talaq was invalid as under Shia law, talaq must be pronounced orally
in the ) gies of two witnesses and the wife and in the set form of Arabic

words’, The requirement is for two, male witnesses to the divorce’.
The only circumstances in which a written divorce is acceptable is if the
husband is physically incapable of an oral pronouncement».
9.8.2 Failure to contend written divorce: However, where a Shia woman

fails to immediately contend a written divorce, she may find difficulty in

having it declared ineffective®.

~~.

9.9 Restrictions on husband's right of divorce
‘Clause 19 of the standard nikahnama offers the option of curtailing (the
word used in the Urdu nikahnama is‘ pabandi') the husband's unilateral
right of divorce. Although the clause is usually struck out during the
nikah ceremony, case law shows that the courts have attempted to uphold
women's right to conclude agreements with their husbands limiting his

right to divorce and thereby expand their control over their own lives.

In one example, the wife claimed to have executed an agreement with her
husband under which in case of divorce he had to pay her a specified
amount.

agreement, which was however proved in court and the agreement was
upheld as valid’.
This was in spite of the fact that in the couple's nikahnama clause 19 had
been struck out. The court held that the fact that the clause had been
struck out does not bar the parties from making any other agreement.

10. IDDAT
Although the iddat waiting period to be observed in the event of
divorce/dissolution of marriage and death of the husband is different, both
carry the stipulation that in the event of pregnancy, iddat terminates
upon delivery or the set iddat period, whichever is later.

Case law on iddat on the death of the husband focuses on the wife's right
to inherit and is dealt with in Part IV of the Handbook regarding
succession and inheritance.

10.1 Iddat and divorce/dissolution of marriage
Since the MFLO does not envisage any distinctions between talaq-i-ahsan
and talaq-i-hasan and attempts to do away with the instantaneous talaqi-bidat, it also regulates the period of iddat to be observed by a woman
following the dissolution of her marriage.

Section 7(3) of the MFLO reads:
Save as provided in sub-section (5) talagq, unless
revoked earlier, shall not be effective until the
expiration of ninety days from the day on which
notice is delivered to the Chairman.
Section 7(5) of the MFLO reads:

If the wife be pregnant at the time talaq is
pronounced, talaq shall not be effective until the
period
mentioned
in sub-section
(3) or the
pregnancy, whichever later, ends.

10.2 Deviations from application of S.7(3)
& (5) of MFLO

The contradictions arising out of the pres
ence of parallel legal systems in
Pakistan, and the confusing implications
this has for women, was clearly
illustrated in a recent judgement regardin
g iddat. While the higher courts
have consistently
ruled that iddat is 90 days in all
instances, the Shariat

:

86

ee
ibi

Ahmed vs. Zeban Bibi 1989 MLD
985

Appellate Bench in a very recent case! stated that the period of iddat
need not always extend to 90 days and could be much shorter. The court
noted the relevant Qur'anic injunction (Surah Al-Baqara (2), Verse 228)
says "And the divorced women
shall wait for three periods of
menstruations" and therefore iddat has to be calculated on an individual
meets In this particular case the judges said it could be as short as 39
ays.

Although this judgement was an attempt to protect a woman who was
facing the charge of zina, many lawyers and women's organisations have
opposed the judgement in that it lays a dangerous precedent for the
shortening of the period of iddat which is the only means of protecting the
woman from the effects of arbitrary and instantaneous divorce. The
judgement could also have a negative impact on suits for maintenance2.

10.3 Iddat on divorce where marriage not consummated
If the marriage was not consummated, there is no iddat period and a
talaq becomes immediately effective and is irrevocable’. This ruling has
been subsequently overruled, upholding the principle outlined in S.7(8) of
the MFLO which ensures that no matter what the circumstances of the
talaq, it is not effective until the expiry of 90 days.

11. MAINTENANCE
In maintenance cases generally, the established principle is that the wife
is entitled to maintenance not only during the subsistence of the marriage
but also on its termination during the period of iddat. Case law thus falls
into two broad categories: maintenance where the marriage still subsists
and maintenance where divorce has taken place.

Additionally, the courts have consistently upheld the right of children
living with their separated/divorced mother to maintenance from their
father. Minor children cannot and should not be deprived of their right to
maintenance on the grounds that they were not living with their father‘.

11.1 Substantive law

can seek a specific order for maintenance from the Arbitration Council

where her husband fails to maintain her adequately, or, where there are

more wives than one, fails to maintain them equitably. She may also
apply for this maintenance certificate to be revised. The quantum of
maintenance is decided upon the basis of the socio-economic status of the
parties!. The courts also take into account the burden of taking care of a
child while fixing the amount of maintenance a husband is to pay®.

The courts appear to decide cases where the husband seeks to have the
amount of maintenance lowered on the specific circumstances of the case®.
11.2 Definition
‘Maintenance’ means keeping in existence, to preserve, to support, to
make good. Maintenance includes provision of food, raiment, lodging and
other necessary expenses for mental and physical wellbeing. The courts
have included the expenses of the delivery of a child within the definition

of physical and mental wellbeing’.
11.3 Wife's property no bar to maintenance
It has been held that the wife is entitled to own property independent of
her husband and is also entitled to exercise her right over this property
where it has been given as part of an order to recover maintenance
through court decree”.

bbs Husband's absence from proceedings no bar to maintenance
order
A husband who was not present but was represented by his relative at
Arbitration Council proceedings regarding maintenance cannot challenge
the order on the grounds that it was passed behind his back!,

11.6 Maintenance during marriage
The courts have consistently upheld the principle that it is the duty of the
husband to maintain the wife during the subsistence of the marriage even
if they be living separately2.
It is not necessary for the wife to live with her in-laws in order to qualify
for maintenance in situations where the husband is working abroad. She
is only disentitled to maintenance where she does not live with her
husband and perform her matrimonial obligations without justification.

The husband is obliged to pay maintenance even in the absence of any
agreement or decree in favour of the wife‘.
11.6.1 Suits for recovery of prompt dower and maintenance: A wife may
live separately until the recovery of her prompt dower but the husband is
nevertheless obliged to maintain her during this period of separation.
Many maintenance suits are of this nature and the courts have upheld
the wife's right to maintenance?.
11.6.2 Polygamy and maintenance: In a pre-partition case in Sri Lanka,
it was held that a wife who refuses to live with her husband on the ground
that he was living with another wife becomes disentitled to maintenance®.
The basis in jurisprudence for this ruling was that when a woman
abandons the conjugal domicile without valid reason she is not entitled to
maintenance’. It is understood that refusal to live with the husband

implies refusal of sexual intercourse; commonly husbands respond to the
wife's suit for maintenance by filing a suit for restitution of conjugal
rights.
In more recent years, however, it has been held that a husband who

contracts a second marriage without the consent of his first wife and in

contravention of the provisions of S.9 of the MFLO is grounds enough for

the wife to live apart from her husband. In this instance, the husband is
also obliged to pay the wife (and child) maintenance’.
It has also been held that a wife living in a polygamous union is entitled
to separate living quarters and maintenance, and that failure to make
such provisions is a grounds for dissolution under the DMMA? (See 8.4.1
above).

11.7 Maintenance and divorce
11.7.1 Maintenance only allowed during iddat: It has been held that a
maintenance order passed in favour of the wife by the Arbitration Council
is not operative after the expiry of iddat, i.e., 90 days after the divorce®.
11.7.2 Reduction in period of iddat rejected: The courts have set aside
the order of the Collector Revenue where he reduced the period of
maintenance established by the Arbitration Council and upheld that the
period of maintenance was from the date of pronouncement of talaq until

it becomes effective'4.
11.7.3 Suit for past maintenance:
The courts have followed a
contradictory course regarding the wife's ability to claim for past
maintenance.

Thus it has been held that under established Muslim jurisprudence there
is no scope for past maintenance®. However, it has also been held that
where the husband neglected to maintain his wife and thus violated his
duty which a Muslim husband was under obligation to perform, the wife
was entitled to past maintenance allowance®. It is of no significance
whether the suit for recovery of maintenance was filed during or after the
subsistence of the marriage, if for the period for which maintenance was
claimed marriage between the parties subsisted’.
11.7.4 Maintenance and khula: The trend regarding the wife's right
to
claim maintenance following a suit for khula appears unstable. The
courts
have generally held that the wife is not entitled to past
or future
maintenance when her marriage is dissolved through khula8
.
However, it has also been held that a woman

11.7.5 Post-divorce maintenance: Although the question of post-divorce
maintenance for the wife has not appeared in Pakistani case law (unlike
India's famous Shah Bano case), traditional Muslim juristic thought is
unanimous that the wife is not entitled to post-divorce maintenance.
But exceptions exist where lifelong maintenance for the wife has been
incorporated as a stipulation in the marriage contract. In one such case!
it was held that "the marital rights ended with the divorce but the
contract subsists till the plaintiff dies or breaks it, and so long as the right
to maintenance

lasts, it cannot be treated as devoid of consideration or

opposed to public policy."2

11.8 Procedural matters
11.8.1 Jurisdiction in maintenance cases: Previously, S.488 of the
Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) could also be invoked in a claim for
maintenance, but since the repeal of that Section in 1981(%) maintenance
suits are to be filed under S.9 of the MFLO, and the family courts have
exclusive jurisdiction to entertain, hear or adjudicate upon matters

relating to maintenance’.

However, maintenance cases are still being filed under S.488. It has been
held that the maintenance of wives and children, a statutory right of
quasi-civil nature, was made enforceable through the coercive machinery
of criminal law in order to cut short the usual delays of civil procedure.
This intent of law cannot be defeated merely because the powers formerly
vested in a Magistrate are now instead to be exercised by a Family Court
Judge. Applications under S.488 CrPC are to be determined in accordance
with the provisions of S.488, despite the fact that now in view of Ss.5 and
20 of the Family Courts Act read with notification dated 5.4.1966, the
Family Court Judge is to entertain and adjudicate maintenance
applications®. Magistrates no longer have jurisdiction to deal with

applications under S.488().

11.8.2 Time limit on suit for maintenance: Recent case law has
established that a wife may seek maintenance from her husband for a

maximum period of six years (an increase over the previously accepted 3
year limit).
It has been held that since there is no article in the 1908 Limitation Act

dealing specifically with the question of recovery of past-maintenance, the
matter is to be governed by Article 120 of the Limitation Act which

THE WEST PAKISTAN DOWRY (PROHIBITION OF DISPLAY) ACT,
1967
This legislation has had absolutely no impact on social norms and the
practice of dowry (jehez) continues unabated. Meanwhile, reported case
law reveals a highly ingenuous attempt by husbands to use of these laws
to their own legal advantage.

12.1 Courts reject attempt to evade return of jehez on dissolution
of marriage
In the few cases invoking these statutes3, all were suits instituted
following the dissolution of marriage wherein claims had been made by
women for the recovery of their movable property comprising of dowry
items or to recover their value.

To counter their wife's suit for return of jehez on the dissolution of their
marriage, it was argued on behalf of the husbands that since the Dowry
and Bridal Gifts Restriction Act 1976 prohibited dowry in excess of Rs.
ie hence returning goods exceeding this value would be a violation of
e law.

are

:

advantage of any breach of law by the parents of the wife in order to
deprive her of her property.

12.2 Purpose of Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act
The court while discussing the purpose of the Dowry and Bridal Gifts
(Restriction) Act, 1976, stated that "it was meant to benefit women to be
married and their parents so that women may not remain unmarried for
lack of heavy dowry. It was not enacted to deprive wives of their dowry
and wari [items given to the bride by the husband on the occasion of the
wedding] in excess of restricted amount of Rs. 5000...instead of being
beneficial to women and wives, the Act has proved to be detrimental to

their rights and interests."2

The court in this instance also took the view that the Act is violative of
the principles of Muslim jurisprudence regarding inheritance and counter

to Qur'anic injunctions’.

12.3 Dowry is property of the wife
Section 5 of the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act clearly provides
that all property given to the wife as dowry or bridal gift shall vest
absolutely in her and that her interest in the property, however derived,
shall not be restrictive, conditional or limited. She is the absolute owner
of the property, to the exclusion of the bridegroom. S.5 also makes no
mention of any limitation to the value of this property and thus neither
the husband nor the government has the right to usurp any property in

excess of Rs 5,000/-(4).

12.4 Limitation on suit for recovery of dowry
In one case®, it was ruled that though the dowry articles remained in the
husband's house during the period when the wife had deserted him, their
presence there was not unlawful as there remained hope for the
resumption of marital relations. Upon divorce, however, the detention of

the dowry articles in the husband's house became unlawful.

In such a case, the period of three years contemplated in Article 49 of the
Limitation Act 1908 began to run from the time of a demand by the wife

for the return of her dowry articles and the refusal of the husband to
deliver them to her.

_ Marriage, Dower
& Divorce
13. RESTITUTION OF CONJUGAL RIGHTS
Although suits for restitution of conjugal rights can be filed by both men
and women, such suits are a standard method of pressurising women
when a couple is experiencing strained relations and is particularly used
by husbands to counter a suit for maintenance. Where the suit by
husband is decreed, he is then absolved of his liability to pay
maintenance.

13.1 Suits by husband rejected by courts
The courts have rejected suits where it is clear that the husband is using
the suit simply as a tool to recover ornaments!, and have insisted the
husband comes to court with “clean hands', i.e., no ulterior motive to his

suit2.
In certain circumstances the higher courts have also strongly criticised
the lower courts for accepting suits for restitution of conjugal rights. In a
case where the lower courts accepted the suit lodged by the first husband
of a divorced woman who had remarried, the higher courts overturned the
order and noted that a grave miscarriage of justice had occurred,
adversely affecting the future of the woman and her children’.

13.2 Wife cannot be compelled to live with husband
While accepting the predominance of the Muslim husband in matrimonial
matters, the courts have stated that this in no way means Islam gives
him an unfettered right to compel the wife to live with him‘.

13.3 Means of enforcing decree for restitution against wife

The question of how the courts can enforce their decree against the wife is
a complex one. The issue has been held to be governed by Order 21, Rule
32 of the CPC. However, other courts have more recently insisted that
S.13(4) of the Family Courts Act is relevant. The courts have
no
established means of enforcing their decree, whose effect is ultimately

arrest against the wife is not warranted).

13.3.2 Husband's right to have wife's property attached in execution: It
has however been held that if the wife refuses to join her husband
following a decree against her, she can be deprived of maintenance
allowance, and where coercive measures have to be adopted to force the
implementation of the decree, then the wife's movable and immovable

property could be ordered to be attached. This means that until she

complies with the court's order, she would be unable, for example, to sell
her property.

However, a decree for the restitution of conjugal rights cannot be executed
against the movable property of a person not party to the proceedings. It
has been held that a wife's mother's property was not liable to be attached
in execution.

13.4 Family Courts to first decide whether couple still married
Where the matter before the court was the question whether or not a
husband was entitled to a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, the
Family Court could not refuse or grant the decree until it had first
decided the woman's plea that she had already been divorced by him and
was no longer his wife. Although the question of whether he had divorced
his wife was not the basis of the suit, the fact that it arose in a suit for
restitution of conjugal rights brought the matter within the Family
Court's jurisdiction‘. In such cases, the court should frame a preliminary
issue as to whether they were still husband and wife before proceeding

any further in the case°.

13.5 Appeal against rejection of suit following dissolution of
marriage

The courts have also rejected attempts by husbands to continue harassing
their former wives even after their marriage is dissolved.
In one case® where the husband appealed against the rejection of his suit,

it was held that by conferring finality on a decree for dissolution of
marriage, the legislature clearly intended that there should be no revival
of any controversy regarding the existance of conjugal relations between
the parties. Therefore, although there is no clear prohibition against an
appeal from an order of a family court refusing restitution of conjugal

14. JACTITATION OF MARRIAGE

14.1 Definition of suit for jactitation
The essence and main object of a suit for jactitation of marriage is to
perpetually silence a false allegation or claim put forward by the
defendant, of a marriage having taken place between the defendant and
the plaintiff’.
A suit for a declaration that the defendant is not the husband or wife of
the plaintiff is a suit for jactitation of marriage, and falls under the
schedule of matters laid out in the Family Courts Act 1964 which are to
be filed before a family court?.

14.2 Jurisdiction in suits for jactitation
Under a 1969 amendment to the West Pakistan Family Courts Act of
1964, suits for jactitation were added to the schedule of matters to be
tried by the family courts. However, under certain circumstances, their
jurisdiction has been questioned.
14.2.1 Who can file suit: A person other than a Muslim citizen of Pakistan
can file a suit for jactitation of marriage. The courts have upheld the
principle that under S.20 of the CPC, a suit, including one for jactitation
of marriage, could be instituted in a court within whose

local limits the

defendant is for the time being residing.
Since the parties in one case were residing in Islamabad and the cause of
action also accrued there, the Senior Civil Judge Islamabad did have
jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit, no matter whether one of the
parties was a person other than a Muslim citizen of Pakistan3,
14.2.2 Suit for cancellation of talaqnama: A suit by a husband for
the
cancellation of a talaqnama along with an application for an injunction
to
restrain the remarriage of his wife is triable by a family court
in that the

and

Similarly, a suit seeking a declaration that a talagnama was obtained
forcibly and was therefore liable to be cancelled with the plaintiff
continuing to be the husband of the woman, is triable exclusively by the
family court2.
14.2.3 Jurisdiction when third person files suit: It has been held that a
Civil Court would be competent to decide a dispute arising out of a
controversy relating to matrimonial relations of two persons when
challenged by a third person?.

14.3 Appeal in suit for jactitation
S.14(2) of the Family Courts Act does not take away the right of appeal
against a decision or decree in a suit for jactitation of marriage. An appeal

against such decisions is possible’4.
However, where an appeal against a decree for jactitation was dismissed
and the decision was not shown to be either unjust or improper on record
and was decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, the higher courts
have refused to entertain a writ petition against the decree®.

1. Courts influenced by social custom, Muslim jurisprudence and
statute law
Analysis of reported Pakistani case law in matters relating to marriage,
dower, divorce, and maintenance reveals certain interesting patterns.
The courts seem to reflect public opinion, societal trends and attitudes
towards the family and domestic relations. For instance it is generally
accepted that what transpires between a husband and wife belongs solely
to the private sphere and as far as possible should be resolved within
those premises -- rather than in the courts.

Secondly, a culture that is skeptical of the efficacy and wary of state
institutions such as the judiciary and police aggravates this situation.
Thirdly, there is the problem of a heterogeneous legal system which
combines laws with completely different normative bases. For instance,
certain aspects of family law are regarded as having their base in religion,
where modification may be more
controversial.
Alongside these
apparently religion based laws are the so-called secular provisions of the
general law of the land, many of them in the case of Pakistan made by

colonial rulers!.

More often than not, legislation on family laws has involved piecemeal
legislative measures trying to compromise political expediency with the
dictates of justice and needs of the time2. The result has been a strange
mixture of customary practices, Muslim jurisprudence and statute law
held together in legislative enactments.
But these laws have only been accepted and used selectively and one
comes across judgments where the ‘Islamic’ nature of a certain statute is
debated. It is pertinent to note here that time and again the courts have
arrived at conclusions on the basis that a certain provision of the law is
unIslamic' and hence may justifiably be disregarded. For
instance
various Sections of the MFLO as well as the DMMA have
met with this
fate. This goes to show that even judges at times do not
consider
aside statute
:
settled law of the land

2. Courts ignore option for judicial divorce
It is disturbing that the bulk of reported case law in the area of family law
concerned dissolution of marriage through khula, where there appears to
be confusion, whether inadvertent or deliberate, of the extent and
operation of the doctrine of khula.
In more than 80%, case law on dissolution of marriage consisted of cases
where women had prayed for a judicial divorce on grounds contained in
the DMMA or the MFLO, but had, in the alternative, asked for a
dissolution on the basis of khula. Judgments invariably granted khula
even though grounds for dissolution of marriage under the DMMA, such
as cruelty or non-maintenance, were proved in court and were even
mentioned as material elements in the award of khula.
If evidence is led by the wife and accepted by the court that the husband
is at fault, then a clear case for a judicial decree for divorce is established
under the DMMA
and the husband is liable to pay dower and
maintenance to the wife. How is dissolution of marriage by khula justified
by the court in these circumstances? Furthermore, if it is a clear case of
khula, then why is the zar-i-khula reduced in proportion to the fault of the
husband?
The conclusion is that in divorce cases, the courts tend to take the least
controversial way i.e., let the woman forego her dower (to please the
husband) and let the woman get her freedom. This is also an indicator of

the unbearable delay in litigation in the country's courts.
The misunderstanding and misuse of the doctrine of khula undermines
women's legal rights on a number of counts. It renders the DMMA
ineffective since all the grounds on which a women can obtain a judicial
divorce as well as retain her dower are ignored. A distinction between a

judicial divorce where

the wife does not forego her dower

and also

succeeds in terminating the marriage contract, and an order granting
khula where the wife foregoes her dower must be clearly drawn. It is also
tantamount to encouraging men to be casual and callous in their duties to

their spouses as the inference one draws from reported case law is that in
the present social set-up, a woman would forego her dower rather then
indulge in prolonged litigation.

3. Encouraging trends
There have nevertheless been some encouraging developments. This
includes trends where the courts have sought to simplify legal action to
the benefit of women and have avoided multiplicity of proceedings;

99

_ Marriage, Dower

_& Divorce

frequently the courts have allowed the joining in one suit of reliefs arising
from the same cause of action between the same parties.
While those who oppose women's freedom to determine their own private
lives (including former husbands and parents), have been able to
manipulate certain provisions of the law and have been supported in their
action by the decisions of the courts, there has been a contrasting trend
whereby the courts have insisted that women are not chattel. In one such
case, the court rejected an attempt by a man to restrain his former wife

from marrying another man!.

4. Conclusion

A study of reported Pakistani case law, reveals that all laws whether
religious or secular have their limits as tools of social engineering and
only those provisions and injunctions are used that perpetuate the status
quo. Pakistan is not the only country where family law debates are raised
in the political arena and where for political gain religious leaders and
liberal politicians alike attempt to undermine progressive legislation in
this field. Efforts to reform family law nonetheless offer women useful
fragments of hope; the thrust must now be towards protecting these laws,
with emphasis on the implementation of what little reprieve they offer,
and ultimately towards reform designed to remove the glaring loopholes
and contradictions in laws affecting women's lives.

1.1 Issues to be covered
Since we are concerned with cases where at least one party is Muslim,

this custody and guardianship section of the Handbook shall consider all
three issues covered in Shariah!:
(i)

Guardians for hizanat;

(ii)

Guardians for marriage;

Gili)

| Guardians for management and preservation of minor's property.

1.2 Variety of factors influencing courts
An analysis of reported case law in the area of custody and guardianship
reveals that there are four basic influencing factors.
Firstly, like all other individuals and institutions, the judiciary cannot
remain above societal norms and political pressures.

Secondly, a combination of Muslim personal law, (both codified and
uncodified with all its variations) and a variety of statutory law (see 2.
below) is applied by courts in adjudicating such cases. This leaves judges
considerable room for discretion allowing them to make their own
interpretation of existing principles. The superior courts in Pakistan have
developed and even modified the established principles of Muslim
jurisprudence regarding custody and guardianship according to the
circumstances of a particular case. This liberty has especially been taken
in the absence of an express Qur'anic text or where the different schools of
thought in Muslim jurisprudence have taken divergent views on an issue.

S.M.I. Mokal, The Guardians And Wards Act 1890 and The Majority Act 1875, Lahore:
Law Publishing Company, 1979, pp. 17-37 where the author also cites extensively from

important works on Muslim Law including Fatawa-i-Alamgiri, Hedaya, Baillie's Digest,
and Fatawa-i-Kazee Khan.
Some provisions of Muslim personal law have been incorporated in statutes, but there
is no one consolidated code covering all areas of personal law; neither would one
uniform code be possible primarily due to the divergent views of the various Schools of
juristic thought.

145

‘Custody and
Guardianship

case law on
The third factor one must bear in mind while analysing
as well
custody and guardianship, is the colonial impact on statutory laws
as in moulding the general trends of the courts in pre-partition India’.
Fourthly, another important principle introduced into the (then) Indian
judiciary by the British was the Roman concept of ‘justice, equity and
good conscience’. Judges have continued to resort to this principle even
after Independence while deciding custody and guardianship cases.
It is important to note that these four influencing factors are not
necessarily complimentary and case law reveals that the courts have
often used one or more of the determinants to the clear exclusion of the
others in making their judgements.

2. OUTLINE OF LEGISLATION
Questions relating to custody and guardianship fall under the purview of
a number of laws. The following gives a brief description of the historical
background and significance of a few of these laws.

2.1 Caste Disability Removal Act (XXI of 1850)
This law was introduced during British colonial rule when conversion of
faith became common and posed a number of problems in family matters,
especially where, according to the principles of Muslim jurisprudence,
apostasy (rejection of faith) or a difference of religion between spouses
affected the legal outcome.

2.2 Majority Act of 1875 & Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929
The Majority Act established that the age of puberty and of majority are
two different stages of maturity which cannot be equated. Through a
subsequent amendment, (Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, VIII of 1961)
the Child Marriage Restraint Act established the minimum legal age of
marriage as 16 years of age for a female and 18 years for a male. Puberty
was also presumed to have been attained on complet i
ompletion of 15 years of age

in the absence of evidence.

2.3 Guardians and Wards Act 1890 (Act VIII of 1890)
Statutes such as the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 were part of an
attempt to codify the often divergent principles derived from different
schools of Muslim jurisprudence to ensure some measure of uniformity
and certainty.

The established view is that "where the provisions of the personal law are
in conflict the provisions of the Guardians and Wards Act 1890, the latter
will prevail over the former"?.
In Pakistan today, the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 is applicable to
custody and guardianship cases while keeping in view the personal law to
which the minor is subject. Personal law is the one applicable to a person
on the basis of his/her religious conviction. The minor is supposed to be
subject to the same personal law as his/her father (See Section C: 12.1
below).

2.4 West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 (Act XXXV of 1964)
Along with the West Pakistan Family Court Rules 1964, the Family
Courts Act is also involved in settling custody and guardianship disputes,
both as the District Court for the Guardians and Wards Act and through
its jurisdiction in the matter of the marriage of minors.

3. DEFINITIONS
3.1 Classification of guardians
Under the Guardians and Wards Act 1890, guardians are classified in the
following manner:
(i)

Natural guardians;

(ii)

Testamentary guardians;

(iii)

|Guardians appointed under the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 by

a District Court and;

(iv)

| Guardians appointed under the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 by

a High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.

The term ‘guardian' has been very widely defined in the Guardians and
Wards Act 1890:
Section 4(2) reads:

"Guardian" means a person having the care of the
person of a minor or of his property, or of both his
person and property.

In discourses on established Muslim jurisprudence, custody of minors (or
guardianship of the person of a minor) is conceded to the mother until a
certain age, whereas the father is termed the natural guardian of the
:
child'.
While control over a minor's property is always referred to as
‘guardianship’ of property, in the matter of the care of the minor's person
more often than not in case law the terms guardianship' and ‘custody’ are
applied interchangeably. No single meaning has been placed on these two
key words (see Section C: 1. below), nor have any clearly defined
parameters been drawn to determine the nature and extent of the
privileges inherent in the persons awarded either custody or guardianship
of a minor. Commentaries on the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 also fail
to make the issue any clearer and the words ‘guardian' and ‘custody' have
been used interchangeably. The only inference we have been able to draw
is that the word ‘guardian' is more often than not used when referring to
the legal guardian whereas ‘custody' is employed while referring to the
mother or any other female holding custody of the minor.

It should be noted that there is no Qur'anic text on the point of custody
and guardianship. The various schools of Muslim jurisprudence have
therefore developed their own, quite divergent, principles regarding the
issue.

1. DISTINCTION BETWEEN CUSTODY AND GUARDIANSHIP
Generally speaking, the terms custody and guardianship seem to have
similar connotations, but it is often argued that guardianship is the
superior right and will always include custody or hizanat!. Guardianship
denotes a legal relationship as opposed to custody which is always
subservient to it. Thus Muslim law categorically asserts that hizanat may
belong to the mother at a particular point in time, yet it is only the father
who is the ‘natural’ guardian. Hence, a mother may have the immediate
custody of the minor, yet the child is still considered in the constructive
possession of the de jure guardian (who is primarily the father)2. Thus
custody of the child is not a condition precedent to be termed a guardian®.

2. DEFINITION OF CUSTODY
Hizanat, or custody, is described in the Hedaya as care of the infant
children’. However, established writings on Muslim jurisprudence do not
provide a more detailed description of precisely what this care entails,
leaving the matter open to interpretation by the courts in the process of
deciding each case on merit.

3. MOTHER AND FATHER'S ENTITLEMENT TO CUSTODY
3.1 Principles under Hanafi law
Under the principles of Sunni Hanafi law, the mother has a preferential
right to the custody of her male child until he has completed his seventh
year and the female child until she attains puberty, to the exclusion of the
father or any other relative’; after that custody reverts to the father.
There are however divergences of opinion here. In the interpretation
given under Shafei law, a mother is entitled to custody of her daughter

even after the girl has attained puberty and until the girl is married2.
4.

3.2 Principles under Shia Law
Under Shia law, the mother is entitled to the custody of a male child until
he attains the age of 2 years and of a female child until the age of 7 years
after which custody belongs to the father3.

4. GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF CUSTODY: PREFERENCE GIVEN TO
FEMALE RELATIVES
An important
rule apparently
finding consensus
among
major
commentators on Muslim law is that in drawing up a list of relatives to be
awarded preferential right to the custody of a minor, it is the mother and
the other female relatives who gain precedence over the father and other
male relatives4.

5.2 Custody in absence of other female relatives
In the default of the mother and other female relatives mentioned above,
the custody of the minor belongs to certain male relatives:!

(i)

the father;

(ii)

nearest paternal grandfather;

(iii)

full brother;

(iv)

| consanguine brother;

(v)

full brother's son;

(vi)

| consanguine brother's son;

(vii)

full brother of the father;

(viii)

consanguine brother of the father;

(ix)

| son of father's full brother;

(x)

son of father's consanguine brother.

However, no male is entitled to the custody of an unmarried girl whom he
can lawfully marry, i.e., unless he stands within the prohibited degree of

relationship to her.

5.3 Custody in absence of all relatives
If no persons falling into the categories mentioned in 5.1 or 5.2 exist, then

it is for the court to appoint an appropriate person to take custody of the
minor.

6. GROUNDS FOR MOTHER'S DISQUALIFICATION FROM
CUSTODY OF MINORS
A general consensus exists among the various Schools as to when
mother or other female who has custody of a minor loses this right’.

a

6.1 Mother's remarriage
The mother, or any other female otherwise entitled to the custody of a
child, generally stands disqualified on her remarriage to a man not

related to the child within the prohibited degree®. This right to custody

however, revives on dissolution of the subsequent marriage either by
death or divorce’. This rule, it is argued by some jurists, must be more
stringently enforced where custody of a female is in question‘.
6.1.1 Explanation of prohibited degree/stranger: Under principles of
established Muslim jurisprudence, some relations are such that it is
prohibited to enter into a valid contract of marriage with them. There are
three classes that constitute prohibited degrees' of relationship.
The first is prohibited on the grounds of consanguinity i.e., blood
relations, thus a man cannot lawfully marry his mother, grandmother
how high so ever, daughter, granddaughter how low so ever, sister
whether full, uterine or consanguine; niece or grand niece how low so
ever, and aunt or great-aunt how high so ever, whether paternal or
maternal.

The second category is prohibited on the grounds of affinity. A man is
prohibited from marrying his wife's mother or grandmother how high so
ever, wife's daughter or grand-daughter how low so ever; the wife of his
father or paternal grandfather how high so ever; and the wife of his son,
son's son or daughter's son how low so ever.
The third set
set of relatives with whom a man ma y not lawfully m arry are
those prohibited on the grounds of fosterage.

stranger - a man who
is not related closely to the child - he/she may not be

6.2 Mother lives far away from father
If the woman, during the subsistence of the marriage, resides at a
distance from the father's place of residence, she loses the right to the
custody of the child'. However this distance has never been defined2. In a
recent case, the court ruled that in this age of modern transportation
distances did not matter much\s,

6.3 Mother's lifestyle/neglect of minor
In instances where a mother is leading an immoral life, and/or where she
neglects to take proper care of the child’, she may stand to be disqualified

from the custody of her minor children.

7. GROUNDS FOR FATHER'S DISQUALIFICATION FROM
CUSTODY OF MINORS
Under Shariah the rules for disqualification of a mother or other females
from the custody of a minor are not mentioned in any major book on
Muslim personal law as being applicable to the father or other male
relatives. However, case law reveals a departure from this principle of
Muslim jurisprudence (See Section C: 4. below).

APOSTASY (rejection of faith)
According to Muslim
apostasy by the mother

There are however divergent views regarding custody in cases of a
difference of religion. The Hedaya states that a zimmeea or female
infidel' subject, married to a Mussalman may have custody of her infant
child but with certain provisos‘. Mulla's

Law

states that

10. GUARDIANSHIP OF PROPERTY
of guardianship
Three types of guardians are recognised for the purpose
i.
of property:
(i)

legal guardians;

(ii)

guardians appointed by the Court; and

(iii) | de facto guardians.

10.1 Legal guardians
10.1.1 Hanafi Law: Under Hanafi law, the following are the guardians of a
minor's property in order of preference:

(i)

father;

(ii)

executor appointed by father's will;

(iii)

father's father;

(iv)
(v)

| executor appointed by paternal grandfather;
executor of the last named executor.

Thus the only persons who are entitled to appoint a guardian of the
property of a minor by will are the minor's father and father's father. The
mother has no power to appoint by will a guardian of the property of her
minor child. Unlike points (ii) and (iii) above, under Shafei law the
paternal grandfather is given preference over the father's executor in
matters of property management.

10.1.2 Shia law: Some interpretations under Shia law resemble the Shafei
interpretation and hold that the father cannot appoint an executor in the
presence of a grandfather who is given preference. But according to
another view, the nomination of an executor by the father is valid to the
extent of one-third of the property and for the discharge of all rights or
claims upon his estate. The power of the executor can be further limited if
the executor so desires.

11. CUSTOMARY
GUARDIANSHIP

PRACTICE REGARDING CUSTODY AND

While there are regional variations, customary law in Pakistan assumes
fathers are the natural guardians of their children and tends to grant
fathers custody of their children's person and property in cases where
custody is disputed; this is particularly so where a widow or divorcee
mother remarries. The age at which the physical custody of children
living with mothers reverts to the father does not always rigidly follow the
principles of established Muslim jurisprudence and in many areas may be
younger than under Muslim personal law.

Section C:

Analysis of Case Law

1. GENERAL ISSUES
Analysis of case law reaching the superior courts reveals that the bulk of
custody and guardianship litigation has fallen under five main strands:
where custody was awarded to the mother; where custody was awarded to
the father; where remarriage was the decisive factor in awarding custody;
where the religion of the parent was the decisive factor in awarding
custody; cases involving custody of minor married females.

On a purely statistical level, the number of cases where the mother has
been given preference by far outnumber the cases where the minor's
father or other male relatives were awarded custody. Even in those cases
where remarriage of the parents was a material factor in deciding
custody, the courts showed no particular disfavour towards the mother on
these grounds, despite the fact that remarriage of the mother to a
stranger is a disqualification under personal law. However, it must be
remembered that this generally sympathetic attitude of the courts
towards women in custody cases is only a result of the courts' perception
of the child's best interests.

1.1 No clear distinction between guardianship and custody
Case law has shown that the courts have given a wide variety of
interpretations to S.4(2) of the Guardians and Wards Act 1890 (See
Section A: 2.3 above).

1.2 Custody defined by case law

1.4. Father is ‘natural guardian’
On the other hand, the law has tended to accept the father as the natural
guardian even when minors are in the custody of the mother!. Imambandi
vs. Mutsaddi is the leading case in the area of custody and guardianship
and is still relied upon by Pakistani courts. It established that even
during the time when the mother has custody, the father is nevertheless
the legal guardian and the child considered under his supervision2.

1.5 Custody does not automatically revert to father
1.5.1 Father has to file case for custody: It should be noted however, that
despite being termed the legal guardian, custody does not automatically
shift to the father once the children reach an age where the mother is no
longer entitled to hizanat under personal law. The father or any one else
wanting custody, has to file a case for custody in the guardian court®.
1.5.2 Court not compelled to pass order in father's favour: Moreover,
although the courts accept that the guardian (meaning the father) is
entitled to custody, ‘no order will be made to that effect unless the court is
satisfied that it will be for welfare of the ward.' The welfare of the minor
is the sole consideration that must prevail in the final analysis and the
fact that the father is the lawful guardian of his minor children does not
compel the Court to pass an order in his favour unless it is in their
welfare to do so‘.
1.5.3 Father's right to custody not absolute: The father's right to custody
is not absolute and if he shows a lack of interest in the minor since he
divorced the minor's mother, custody has been refused?.

1.6 Mother also considered guardian
Although the exception rather than the rule, there are cases where, in the
absence or in the event of the disqualification of the father or other male
guardians, the mother is accorded the status of guardian. Thus, the word
‘guardian’ has been interpreted as including a person who has custody of

the minor®.

Custody and
_ Guardianship
2. WELFARE OF THE MINOR' IS PARAMOUNT
2.1 Justifies deviation from general principles of custody and
guardianship
The lack of clarity and uniformity of rules relating to custody and
guardianship is perhaps the single most important factor used to justify
deviation from the general principles of personal law regulating this area.
Working under the broad framework of the principle that the welfare of
the minor is always of paramount consideration'!, courts in Pakistan have
succeeded in making inroads-into established Muslim jurisprudence and
at times have even overridden express provisions of law. The courts have
clearly declared that in certain instances personal law is subordinate to
the welfare of the minor2.
For instance in one case it was held that although under Muslim law
there is presumption that the welfare of the minor lies in living with the
party entitled to hizanat, this can be rebutted: "the paramount
consideration in the matter of the custody of a minor of tender years is the

interest of the child and not the rights of the parents."3
Similarly, in another case‘ it was stated:

".... it would be permissible for courts to differ from the rule
of hizanat stated in the text books on Muslim Law for there
is no Qur'anic or traditional text on the point. Courts which
have taken the place of Qazis can, therefore, come to the
conclusions by the process of Ijtihad which, according to
Imam-al-Shafei is included in the doctrine of Qiyas. It has
been mentioned earlier that the rule propounded in
different text books on the subject of hizanat is not uniform.
It would therefore be permissible to depart from the rule
stated therein, if on the facts of a given case, its application
1s against the welfare of the minor. I am fortified
in this
view by the instance in which a Qazi finding
hardship in
the application of a rule of law to which
the parties
belonged sent the case to the Qazi of another school
of law
which took a liberal view of the matter."5

2.2. Justifies overturning of agreement between parents
The welfare of the minor can overrule an agreement between the parents
regarding the father's right to custody. In one case the separated parents
of a minor girl entered into a deed under which custody would remain
with the mother only until the minor attained seven years of age or until
the mother contracted a second marriage. However, the father's lack of
interest in the minor and his own remarriage was held to indicate the
welfare of the minor lay with her mother irrespective of the agreement

between the parties!.

2.3 Justifies overruling age limitations under personal law
The welfare of the child equally justifies granting custody of a minor
beyond a certain age to a parent who would otherwise under personal law
be disentitled from custody. Thus in one case custody of a boy over the age
of seven years was granted to his mother; regarding the custody of a
minor female, in the same case the court observed Section 17(4) (of the
Guardians and Wards Act, 1890) requires that rights of control of a
eee
should preferably be given to mother without any limitation
of age'*.

2.4 Justifies keeping minor siblings united
The courts also consider whether it would be conducive to the welfare of
the minor to be separated from a sibling, where in the rigid application of
Muslim personal law, for example, a female child has remained with the
mother while custody of a minor boy has been awarded by the lower

courts to the father®.
2.5 Definitions of welfare of the minor’
From the sections 2.5.1 - 2.5.3 below, it can be seen that there are a
variety of views, some of which may be contradictory, on what constitutes
‘welfare of the minor’.

2.5.1 ‘Welfare’ a matter of fact: “Welfare' is considered a question of fact
to be resolved on consideration of material evidence placed before the

court and not on any presumption (including presumptions under Musli
personal law)'. Welfare of the minor cannot be determined by summary
es
proceedings under S.491 CrPC since determination of welfare requir
evidence and is to be settled by a Guardian J udge?.
2.5.2 Factors listed in considering ‘welfare': The Guardians and Wards
Act lists the following considerations regarding the welfare of the child:
i) the age, sex and religion of the minor;

ii) the character

and

capacity of the proposed

guardian

and

his/her

nearness of kin to the minor;

iii) the wishes, if any, of a deteased parent;
iv) any existing or previous relations of the proposed guardian with the
minor or his/her property;
v) if the minor is old enough to form an intelligent preference, the court
may consider that preference;

vi) the court shall not appoint or declare any person to be a guardian
against his/her will.

2.5.3 definition of ‘welfare' in case law: In case law the welfare of a minor
has been taken as meaning his/her material, intellectual, moral and
spiritual well being?; in another case, the matters to be considered in
determining award of custody were cited as the comfort, health and moral
and spiritual welfare of the child/ren4. Welfare also includes the adequate
and undisturbed education of the minor®. The mental and psychological
development of the minor should also not be adversely affected by a
reversal of the existing status quo®.
It has been repeatedly specified in case law that the religion in which a
minor is _brought up is a very important factor, amongst other
considerations, which affects the welfare of the minor’.

2.6 Presumption that welfare lies with mother
At the same time there is the presumption on the part of the court that
the welfare of the minor invariably lies with the mother. Hence
statements to the effect that there can be no substitute for maternal love
and affection. It has equally been held that the mother's biologic

relationship with minors takes precedence over a relationship established
through extended custody and care! (also see 10. below on custody of
foster children and orphans).
2.7 Personal law and welfare
Last but not least, although the courts do invoke rules of personal law, it
is primarily where they believe these to be in the interest of the minor2.
Wherever it is evident before the court that by following a particular rule
of law, the welfare of the minor would be prejudicially affected, the judges
have looked elsewhere to determine welfare. In fact, the English concepts
of justice, equity, and good conscience, a legacy of the British legal system,
have been retained as the underlying guiding principles in custody cases.

For example, despite the principle that the mother's residing far away
from the father disqualifies her (See Section B, 6.2 above), in a recent case
involving a foreign Muslim mother residing abroad (a British national of
Pakistani origin) the courts nevertheless awarded her custody.

2.8 Importance of minor's preference
Although case law is not entirely consistent in this area, in general the
courts have wherever possible taken the minor's own preferences into
account when deciding upon who should have custody.
2.8.1 Minor's preference taken into account: The superior courts have
chided the lower courts for failing to ascertain the wishes of a minor’, and
have further held that consideration of whether a minor is old enough to
make an intelligent preference plays a decisive role in determining the
suitability and desirability of a person seeking the minor's custody‘.
Indicating another departure from the rigid application of personal law,
the courts have also considered the preference of minor females to remain
with their mother beyond the age of puberty”.

2.8.2 Minor's preference not taken into account: In contrast to the point
in 2.8.1 above, it has also been held that the question of the consent of
minors does not arise®. Equally a minor's preference was disregarded in
favour of the strict application of personal law in a case involving
adoption and a difference of religion’.

3. COURTS PREFER CASE-BY-CASE APPROACH
Although in guardianship cases the father is considered the child's
‘natural’ and legal guardian, a study of Pakistani case law amply
demonstrates that the courts have preferred a case-by-case consideration
of the facts rather than figidly applying the principles of established
Muslim jurisprudence.

4. CUSTODY AWARDED TO MOTHER
The bulk of the case law appeared in this area. Under the rules of
established Muslim jurisprudence, the custody of a minor reverts to the
father after a certain age. A study of case law shows that even where
minors had crossed this age, the courts awarded custody to the mothers
thus deviating from established Muslim jurisprudence.

4.1 Father proves unfit
While the law accepts the father as the natural guardian even when the
children are in the custody of the mother2, it has been held that a natural
or certificated guardian may prove himself to be an undesirable person

4.2 Father fails to provide maintenance
A cardinal principle of the patriarchal family is that the father is the
‘provider’. Thus during the time when the minor is in the custody of the
mother, the father is still bound to meet expenses incurred by the mother

in bringing up the child/children'. The court decides, taking into account
the parents' means and status, what is adequate maintenance.
Failing to provide maintenance, proven through oral testimony, is
considered as a sign of abandonment of the father's right to custody and
may weaken his claim2.
But it should be noted that this is only a possibility, not a guarantee of
the loss of his claim, as there are many precedents where it has been held
that even though the father did not pay maintenance until he was
compelled by the criminal court, he has not been deprived of custody of his
children’.

4.3 Courts reject malafide custody suits
The courts consistently reject claims for custody that are proven to be
aimed at evading maintenance, even where the minor has crossed the age
at which custody should revert to the father under personal law’.

4.4 Mother economically stronger than father
Despite general acceptance of the father's role as provider", in situations
where the mother is in a stronger financial position and able to provide
better education and other facilities in life to her children than the father,
the court may allow the child to remain in the custody of the mother®. The
decision as to what exactly is financially stronger is made on a case-bycase basis.

4.5 Mother's weak financial status does not debar her from
custody
Revealing a trend where the courts appear to favour a mother's rights to
custody and a contrast to the point in 4.4 above, her lack of financial

resources is irrelevant in determining a mother's suitability for custody of
her child'.

4.6 Mother's ill-health does not debar her from custody
It has also been held that the mother's poor health is no grounds

for

refusing her custody of a minor?.

4.7 Courts reject allegations regarding mother's lifestyle
The Courts tend to reject baseless and malafide allegations regarding the
mother's character. The couyts have overruled in appeal a lower court
judgement granting the father custody and disregarded both the father's
allegations regarding the mother's character and her remarriage®.

4.8 Father loses right because of delay
The amount of time which lapses between the date on which the father
becomes entitled to the custody and the filing of a claim also plays an
important role in deciding custody cases, as the courts tend to rely on the
English doctrine of unreasonable delay (laches)4. Thus where the father
failed to claim custody within a reasonable time after the mother's
remarriage or his knowledge thereof, he was presumed to have abandoned
his right to custody of the infants®. In this case, despite living very near
his former wife and the passage of some 4 years since her remarriage, he
earlier failed to seek custody of his minor children on the grounds of her
remarriage and failed to provide an explanation for the delay.

5. CUSTODY AWARDED TO FATHER
Similarly, but in a lesser number of cases, fathers have been awarded
custody of minor child/ren despite the fact that in many cases they were
still within the age group where the mother was otherwise entitled to
their custody (See Section B: 3.1 and 3.2 above). This again goes to prove
that rather than simply follow the letter of the law, the judges
felt the
need to go beyond it to ascertain the spirit of the law.

Limitations

Since the mother's custody is often interpreted as a subordinate custody
and one that is subject to the father's control, she is not entitled to remove
the child against the father's wishes to a place where he cannot exercise
supervision and control over the child', and if she does so, she loses her
right to custody of the child2.
However all the circumstances cited below as factors leading to the
mother's loss of custody rights are questions of fact that have to be
substantiated by evidence and only on conclusive proof will the court
agree to award custody of a minor of tender years to a person other than
the mother.

5.1 Mother delays claiming custody
The fact that the mother does not take prompt action to receive custody of
a minor from his/her father immediately after separation between the
parties has in some cases disentitled her to have interim custody of the
minor, as for example in one case involving a boy below seven years of age

who had lived with his father since birth’.
5.2 Improper care and/or negligence towards the child's welfare
It is significant that a survey of case law reveals no example where the
courts specifically cited the mother's negligence as grounds for rejecting
her claim for custody of a minor. In the cases where the courts ruled that
the welfare of the minor lay with the father despite the provisions of
personal law, it was invariably the circumstances of the mother - rather
than her specific actions - which led the court to award custody to the
father.

For example in a more recent case, evidence on record showed that the
mother herself left the minor with the father who had looked after the
child well and who had ensured the child attended school. The mother on
the other hand was not living with her own parents and living at a dera (a
feudal's traditional meeting place) where she worked and where there

would be no schooling facilities for the child4.

5.3 Mother regarded unfit or leads an immoral life
The courts have not sought to define either the term ‘unfit’ or “immoral
life', but have judged each case according to the material placed on
evidence. In one example where the mother's lifestyle was clearly
regarded as an unsuitable environment for her minor daughter, evidence

6. REMARRIAGE OF PARENT(S)

6.1 Scholarly opinion varied
One reason for the often contradictory rulings in this area of case law may
be the lack of unanimity on the subject among scholars of Muslim
jurisprudence and absence of a clear Qur'anic or traditional text (See 2.1
above).

6.2 Departures from established Muslim jurisprudence favour
mother
It was in this category that the review of case law revealed the most
radical departure from established Muslim jurisprudence. The mother's
remarriage is laid down as a disqualification in granting custody of minor
children whereas that of the father is not?. But case law analysed so far
bears out that courts have often disregarded this principle and the
mother's remarriage has not always led to her losing her custody rights.
Equally, the remarriage of the father was taken into account in deciding
custody cases. This is despite that there is no mention of this factor as a
disqualification in major writings on Muslim jurisprudence.

6.3 Welfare of minor paramount
Under all circumstances involving the remarriage of either one (father or
mother) or both of the parents, the welfare of the child remains the
paramount consideration in determining who is fit to be awarded custody.
Since the issue to be decided

is the welfare

of the minor,

which

is a

question of fact rather than law, there is flexibility in the application of
the rules. The point has been well made in Zohra Begum vs. Latif

7. REMARRIAGE OF MOTHER
7.1 Principle of mother's disqualification not rigidly followed
A study of Pakistani case law on this subject reveals that the principle of
the mother's remarriage leading to disqualification has never been rigidly
followed. Opinion seems almost evenly divided as to whether a mother
loses her preferential right to custody or hizanat on remarrying.

7.2 Where mother lost right to custody
There are cases in which there has been a rigid application of personal
law, where

the court has stated that under Muslim

law the mother

is

disqualified from guardianship, even of her minor daughter, if she is
married to a man not related to the minor within the prohibited degree.
Where the law definitely lays down that an appointment of a certain
guardian cannot be made, it is not proper to discard the law even in the
interest of the minor’.
Similarly in another case? it was held:
. court presumes that welfare of minor lies in custody
with guardian recognized by personal law .... If guardian
under personal law is not found to suffer from any serious
disqualification, then the court should invariably give
custody to him....the rule that the mother loses right of
hizanat on marrying a stranger is to be enforced with
absolute jealousy when female child is approaching age of
puberty....custody of female minor to be restored to father if
"

he does not suffer serious disqualification "5
But generally in case law on whether the remarriage of the mother acts as
a bar to her being awarded custody of her minor child, the circumstances
of the case have been the determining factor4. While the rules of personal
law have been invoked accordingly, they have invariably been qualified by
the welfare of the minor.

For example, in one case evidence was placed on record showing that a
minor female's mother did not enjoy good reputation and had inadequate

7.3 Mother's remarriage not sole grounds for denying custody
The courts have ruled that the remarriage of the minors' mother could not
form the sole basis of a decision to deprive her of the right of hizanat. In
one case2, the court while overturning the Appellate court decision of
granting custody to the father ruled that all other reasons were
subordinate to the paramount consideration of the child's welfare.

7.4 Where mother nevertheless retained right to custody
Although the courts have ruled that the disqualification of the mother's
remarriage only applies to female minors, mothers who have remarried
have nevertheless retained custody of female children on the grounds of
the welfare of the minor. By awarding custody of a female child
approaching puberty to her mother where the minor will live in a house
where the stepfather or husband of the female appointed as guardian is
not a mehram4, the courts have certainly moved beyond the defined
parameters of Muslim law, and have instead given preference to the
principle of the welfare of the minor. Decisions where remarried mothers
were nevertheless awarded custody of female children who are close to or
past puberty have appeared in superior court case law largely since the
1980s.

In one case, custody of a girl over ten years old was awarded to the
mother despite her remarriage, where it was held that the father's
circumstances were not safe and convenient for a girl of such age®.
In yet another case, the court dismissed the petitioner's appeal for custody
of his deceased step-brother's daughter in circumstances where evidence
showed he sought guardianship purely in order to gain control of the
minor female's property inherited from her deceased father. The
court
observed that when a proper person applies for guardianship, but

Analysis of

__ Caselaw

forward to claim guardianship, the loss of the mother's preferential right
to hizanaat on account of her remarriage is immaterial!.
Custody also reverts to a remarried mother where the maternal
grandmother is regarded as not fit because of her old age and infirmities.
A pomeecd mother has even been given precedence over a consanguine
brother.

7.5 Custody restored on dissolution of mother's second marriage
The mother's remarriage is not a permanent bar to her right to custody of
her children and where her second marriage is dissolved, she may regain
custody. In one example, custody of a ten-year old minor girl, residing
with her step-maternal grandfather and grandmother, was restored to her
mother following the dissolution of her second marriage and expression of
the minor's wish to remain with her mother.

8. BOTH PARENTS REMARRY
In instances where both parents remarry, the courts have again given the
welfare of the minor precedence over other factors, including the
disqualification of a mother through remarriage. In one case, custody of a
female minor was given to the maternal grandmother4, while another
case involving a habeas corpus ruling on temporary custody favoured the
mother’.

8.1 Both parents lose right of custody
In a ruling based both upon assessments of the welfare of the female
minor
and traditional
principles of Muslim
law, the maternal
grandmother was awarded custody where both parents had remarried®.

In another case’, it was held that if the mother failed to retain custody
rights after her remarriage (and the father had also lost his custody
rights), the maternal grandmother was the next person entitled to
custody to female minors.

9. REMARRIAGE OF FATHER
Case law reveals that in many instances the courts have included the
remarriage of the father as an important determining factor in custody
cases.

9.1 Preference shown to mother over stepmother
A mother's affection for her child is generally regarded as a largely
biological phenomenon. While a minor may not have any conscious
affection

for

his/her

real

mother

having

lived

with

the

father

and

stepmother for a number of years, when mother and child come close to
each other, nature would have its course’.

Preference has been shown for the mother where the father of minor
daughters had contracted another marriage while the mother had chosen
to remain single. The father also had children from the subsequent union.
The court held that a father or a stepmother cannot substitute the
maternal love and affection that the mother would have for her child2.

In a similar case, a father working in Saudi Arabia applied for custody of
his minor children. He had, after divorcing the mother of these children,
married again. The court was of the opinion that were the minors handed
over to the father, he would himself not be available to look after them.
They were likely to live with their stepmother and would be at her mercy.
Hence, in the interests of the minors the mother was granted custody’.

9.2 Stepmother does not disqualify father from custody
However, where stepmothers have been issueless,
the Sane of a stepmother does not stand in the
the minor“. Moreover, the factum of a father having
children out of that union is “never regarded as
disentitle him?.

10. CUSTODY OF ORPHANS AND FOSTER CHILDREN
10.1 Foster children
While the courts have often overruled the principles of Muslim personal
law on the plea of the welfare of the child in general custody cases, in
cases involving the custody of foster children, the courts have almost

invariably favoured the application of Muslim personal law in deciding
custody.
The courts have generally held that the welfare of a foster child lies with
the minor's biological parents, no matter whether the foster parents have
had custody of the minor over an extended period.

It has been held that minors will always have the right to inherit from
their real parents no matter whether their name has been changed by
their foster parents and no matter how long the passage of time since the

minors' adoption".

10.2 Orphans: custody of minors where one or both parents have
died
10.2.1 Care since birth irrelevant: A foster mother, who had raised a
minor girl since birth, was unable to retain custody of her following the
death of the minor's foster father (who was also the child's real uncle). In
this case, the court while applying principles of Muslim personal law
noted custody of a minor girl who has attained puberty rests in the father,
failing which custody belongs to the minor's paternal relatives. The court
also observed that the petitioner-foster mother, as the minor's uncle's
wife, figures nowhere in the Scheme of Law in relation to the right of
hizanat of the minor girl?.
10.2.2 Maternal relatives given preference over living father: The welfare
of minors whose mother has died and whose father has failed to provide
maintenance following divorce has been held to rest with the minors'
maternal grandmother®.

10.2.3. Living father given preference over maternal relatives: In
contrast to the case law in 10.2.2. above, in another case the court held
that the welfare of the minor lay in the restoration of interim custody to
her father rather than with the maternal-grandfather‘.
10.2.4 Living mother given preference over paternal relatives as
guardian for property: A superior court has upheld of the decision of a

trial court appointing a mother as guardian of the person and property of

decision of the high court granting custody to the paternal sister’.
Similarly, where a deceased father's brother held custody of minor girls
with a view to forcing their mother to marry his cousin and deprive them
of their property, the detenus were recovered through a bailiff and their
custody delivered to their mother?.

11. VISITATION RIGHTS

~

11.1 Children need balanced upbringing
The courts have recognised the need for minors in certain instances to
have access to both parents, no matter which has been granted custody.
Thus it has been held that occasional meetings between mother and child
in office premises for a few hours (as ordered by the District Judge), were
not considered sufficient or satisfactory for the welfare of the minor; it is
necessary that the intimate, sobering and mellowing influence of the
mother should be made available to the minor with a view to lending that
balance and direction to his personality which he badly needed. The court
directed wider visitation rights be available to the mother’%.

The courts have similarly directed that fathers be granted regular access

to their children’.

12. DETERMINING CUSTODY ON BASIS OF RELIGION
Under Muslim law, a difference of religion between a minor and the
proposed guardian is considered of prime importance in deciding
custody/guardianship cases.

Where the mother or any other relative professing a religion other
than
that of the father, claims custody of the minor, the courts have

the only aspect of traditional

The courts have rarely attempted to apply the personal law of those
parties who were non-Muslim in instances where the other party in the
custody case was Muslim.

12.1 Minor subject to same personal law/religion as father
The minor is subject to the same personal law as his/her father and
follows the same religion’. Therefore a child born a Muslim remains a
Muslim unless he/she renounces the Muslim faith (on attaining puberty)2,
this fact being irrespective of the religion of the mother3.

12.2 Other aspects of minor's welfare are secondary
No matter where the welfare of a minor otherwise lies, the courts seem to

jealously guard the prerogative of the father to have the minor profess his
religion regardless of what that may be. A study of Pakistani case law
reveals the fact that this rule is applied notably in cases where the
proposed guardian follows a religion different to that of the father.

12.3 Custody since birth irrelevant
The established principles that biological parents have a greater claim to
minors over foster parents and that the father has the right to determine
his child's religion were combined in one case where it was held that
custody of a minor with her (Christian) foster parents since birth should
revert to her real (Muslim) father following the death of her fosterfather/real uncle’.

12.4 Father's right subsists even after death
The courts have held that the father has the right to determine the
religion of his infant children and such right subsists even after his
death®. In a landmark ruling disqualifying a guardian because his/her
religion is different from the child's father, the facts were as follows: on
the death of the husband, the mother of the minor (appellant) who was
originally a Christian but converted to the Muslim faith after her

marriage with the deceased, left her parents-in-law and went to live with

her Christian parents. Although the mother remained a Muslim when she

went

likely to bring up the child in the Muslim religion. Therefore custody was
granted to the paternal aunt to ensure that the child was brought up in
the religion of his father".

12.5 No particular favour shown to Muslim mother/female relative
The courts continue to guard the father's right to custody even in cases
where the father is non-Muslim and the mother/female relatives Muslim.
Where of a Hindu couple, the wife converted to Islam after the death of
her husband, the court held that welfare of the minor demanded that
custody in these circumstances be given to the Hindu uncle and not to the
Muslim mother?.

12.6 Mother residing abroad
12.6.1 Custody denied: In another case, the minor was the offspring of a
Muslim father and a Jewish mother. The court ruled that it would be
improper to hand over custody to the mother who was an Indian national]
residing in India®%. In this particular case the mother's residence in India
seems to have additionally weakened her case.
12.7 Foreign, non-Muslim mother
Under the principles of Muslim jurisprudence laid out in Fatawa-iAlamgiri, only a Muslim is considered a competent guardian for a Muslim
child and a non-Muslim stands disqualified, even if it is the mother of the
minor‘. There are however divergent views on this issue (See Section B: 8.
above on Muslim jurisprudence in this area).
In past cases where non-Muslim foreign mothers claim custody of their
children born of Muslim Pakistani men, the courts tended to favour the
fathers. In recent years however, with the introduction of the use of
S.491, foreign mothers have been able to at least gain temporary custody
of their children pending the decision of the Guardian Courts; in some
instances, the woman

12.7.2 ‘Islamic' atmosphere not obligatory: The lack of opportunity for
practicing the religion (Islam) of the father is an argument used to deny
foreign women custody2. The courts also emphasise the presence of an
‘Islamic atmosphere! and the mother being a Muslim is not considered
sufficientS. However in the landmark Gulbahar case4, the Lahore High
Court rejected the secular nature of Uzbekistan as grounds for
disqualifying the Uzbek mother from custody.

13. APOSTASY AND GUARDIANSHIP/CUSTODY
The traditional view of Muslim jurisprudence, that apostasy by the
mother disqualifies her from custody, does not enjoy universal acceptance
by all schools of thought (See Section B: 8. above).
It also underwent a change during British rule in the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent when many natives' converted to Christianity or other religions
from their former faiths. The Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850)
and the Freedom of Religion Acts were introduced to overcome any such
problems facing new converts.

13.1 Mother's apostasy not necessarily a disqualification
In a pre-1947 case, a divorced Muslim woman remarried a Buddhist but
was still appointed guardian in the interests of the minor‘.

13.2 Father's apostasy no disqualification
In one complex case®, the father gained custody even after issuing a
declaration that he wished to convert from Islam to Christianity, while

the mother remained a Muslim having converted from Christianity.
Despite the fact that the father had also served a three-year sentence for
an offence under the Official Secrets Act, the court held he was also not
disentitled to custody due to his conviction. The mother meanwhile was

held to be living an immoral life and custody of the minor daughter was
given to the father and paternal grandmother on condition of depositing
Rs. 10,000 in court for the minor's benefit.

14. CUSTODY OF CHILD-WIFE
Reported Pakistani case law on the custody of a child-wife is minimal in
comparison to the amount of litigation on other custody and guardianship
issues. An optimistic inference is that social trends have moved away
from child marriages.
But an overview of case law on the subject leads to the conclusion that
child marriages are quite acceptable and prevalent and that the statutory
laws aiming to restrain such practices may, at most, have only initiated a
gradual process of change.

A study of the case law raises some interesting issues. In some cases a
minor girl had been married for some time but was leading a miserable
life; pleading that their daughter is a minor, the parents try to bail her
out of a difficult situation‘. If the parents demand custody of their minor
daughter from the husband (in whose custody she presumably is), then
why did the parents marry off their minor child in the first place? More
importantly, how is it that in cases of this nature, the statutory age of
majority is usually invoked rather than the one acceptable under Muslim
law? Many cases reaching the courts involve a basic disagreement
between the girl and her family as to her choice of spouse.

Ramzan

vs.

This area of case law reveals an interesting interaction between statute
law, customary practices and religious law, where there is a difference in
the age of majority under Muslim jurisprudence and under the Majority

Act (IX of 1875).

According to Muslim jurisprudence, puberty is considered the sole legal
determinant of adulthood no matter how early it comes about. In the
absence of evidence to the contrary, a Muslim girl is presumed to have
attained puberty at the age of fifteen. Meanwhile a minor may be
contracted into a valid marriage by his/her guardian’. It is this
technicality that provides grounds for litigation. However, a number of
other laws affect this privilege given to guardians under Muslim law.

14.1 Laws regulating age of majority and guardianship in

marriage

14.1.1 The Majority Act 1875: Fixes eighteen years as the age of majority
for citizens of Pakistan but neutralizes its impact by excluding from its
purview the capacity of any person to act in the following matters
(namely), marriage, dower, divorce and adoption?.

Thus for all practical purposes, the provisions of the Majority Act 1875, do
not change Muslim personal law regarding the age of majority.
14.1.2 The Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929:
marry off a female below the age of sixteen
eighteen. But, as the title of this law suggests,
restraint and a marriage of a minor solemnized

Act is not invalid’.
14.1.3 The Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961 (MFLO): Requires all
marriages of Pakistani citizens to be registered while the standard
printed nikahnama form contains a column for stating the age of the bride
and bridegroom. But here too, there is a provision for a vakil or
representative of both parties to act on their behalf, which means that if a
bride is a minor she can still be validly contracted in marriage by her
guardian.

Custody and
Guardianship
14.2 Distinction between age of puberty and the age of majority
By accepting the fact that age of puberty and discretion are two different
stages of maturity that cannot be equated, the courts are once again
moving beyond traditional law.

In one case! the following distinction was drawn between ‘the age of
puberty’ and ‘the age of discretion': the husband is the natural guardian
of a woman below the age of discretion (18 years), but he cannot claim
custody in preference to the right of the father who is the legal guardian.
May one hope then, that by creating a precedent where the age of
majority for girls in matters of marriage is being raised to touch 18 years,
the first step towards a wider implementation of statutory laws has been
taken.

14.3 Woman's preference considered
When determining custody of a married minor female, reported case law
indicates that the courts have generally given priority to her preferences,
no matter whether she was below or above the age of majority at the time
of hearing.

Where the detenu has been sui juris and unwilling to go either with her
husband or her guardian, the courts have set her at liberty, allowing her
to move freely2.

14.4 Option can be exercised by woman married before 18

In a number of cases, the courts accepted
statement that she was unhappily married
with their husband, and insisted upon the
allowing her to exercise the option of puberty.
The innovation in this regard is the court's

who sought custody!. Where the husband of a 15 year old minor female
filed a habeas corpus petition against the minor's parents who opposed
their marriage, the courts ruled that having attained the age of puberty
under personal law, the woman is at liberty to go with her husband2.

14.6 Courts disregard woman's preference
Although the general trend in case law in this field has been to accept the
woman's preferences, in certain cases it has been held that a female under
the age of 18 cannot be set at liberty to go wherever she pleases. This was
despite the fact that the personal law to which she is subject recognises
her as an adult and capable of making an independent decision. Her
guardian whoever he or she may be, is entitled to keep her in his/her
custody till such time as she attains the age of 18 years’.

14.7 Custody of minor granted to parents/former guardians
The trend of the courts appears to be to grant custody of a married female
below 18 years of age to the person who would otherwise be entitled to

have custody were she not married’.

It is significant that in cases of dissolution of marriage on the plea of
puberty, the mother of the minor is often considered the guardian rather
than the father, in the belief that the mother understands the minor's
situation while the father may have an economic interest in her

remaining married.°
14.8 Custody granted to third party
In one habeas corpus petition®, where the minor married female's parents
registered a case of abduction against the respondent but the minor
female stated she had married the respondent of her own free choice, the
court (with the consent of the parties) handed over custody to a third
person until a compromise or a decision on the case was reached.

14.9 Minor married woman's detention by husband not illegal but
improper
The courts have ruled that a minor married female's detention in the
private custody of her husband may not be termed illegal, however in

14.10 Mother given preference over husband and father

In the above case, the details were that a 7-8 year old girl was given in
marriage by her father in exchange for his second wife (watta satta).
Following the murder of his second wife, the minor married female was
kidnapped by her husband. The court found that in the case of a minor
married female below the age of puberty, the mother had the right of
custody in preference to both the father and the husband, as the mother is
more concerned about the safety and security of the girl.

15. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
CODE
Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan when read with Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898, S.491 provides that the writ jurisdiction of the
High Courts can be invoked to offer temporary relief in custody and
guardianship disputes, while the parties await the outcome of their case
pending in the Guardian Courts. The need for temporary relief is justified
by the fact that the Guardian Court case may take years, which in the life
of a child is a long time.

Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) providing for habeas
corpus directions is invoked when, for example, a minor is forcibly kept by
the father while the mother is thrown out of the house. Proceedings under
S.491 are meant to immediately restore custody. They are summary
proceedings and conclude soon, without any evidence being led by the
parties.

15.1 Article 199 and S.491 CrPC restore temporary custody
In habeas corpus petitions, custody of the minor may be temporarily
restored to the petitioner-parent. But since it is within the jurisdiction
of
the Guardian Court to decide the final welfare of the child,
custody of
minors cannot be granted to a petitioner-mother entitling
her to remove
the minors from the jurisdiction of the Pakistan
Courts; temporary
custody is therefore restored but only in Pakistan
subject ‘to the final
determination of guardianship/custody by the Guardi
an Court3.

The mere invoking of the jurisdiction of the Guardian Judge under S.25 of
the Guardians & Wards Act does not debar a parent from invoking

jurisdiction under S.491, CrPC}.

Matters to be dealt with by S.491, CrPC and the Guardians and Wards
Act S.25 are entirely different and the provisions are neither mutually
exclusive nor one overlaps or destroys the other2. In exceptional cases, the
High Court can interfere and order the restoration of custody which has
been disturbed illegally and improperly3.
S.491 CrPC is definitely more efficacious, speedy and appropriate and is
to be exercised without prejudice to the rights of the parties involved in a

case under the Guardians and Wards Act4.

16.2 Due weight given to judgement of foreign courts
In two similar appeals for habeas corpus where the father had removed
minors to Pakistan in breach of orders from foreign courts, temporary
custody was restored to the mother pending the final outcome of custody

cases in the Guardian Courts®.
However, it must be noted that in the matter of the final decrees of the
Guardian Courts the trend is as yet not stable; mothers who have been

granted custody of their children by courts abroad have in some instances
had custody confirmed by the Pakistan courts and in some instances had
custody denied. A number of such cases are currently pending with the
Guardian Courts and therefore citations are as yet not available.

Custody and
Guardianship
17. GUARDIANSHIP OF PROPERTY
17.1 Rights of guardians over movable properties
17.1.1 Legal guardians: In the landmark case Imambandi vs. Mutsaddi’,
it was held that a legal guardian has the power to sell or pledge the goods
and chattels of the minor for the minor's imperative necessities, such as
food, clothing or nursing.

17.1.2 Guardians appointed by the court: In the absence of legal
guardians, the court is competent to appoint a guardian for the protection
and preservation of a minor's property®. However, under the Guardians
and Wards Act 1890, a guardian appointed by the court is bound to deal
with the minor's movable properties as carefully as a man of ordinary
prudence would deal with his own property. That is, he may alienate it
(dispose of it or pledge it) only in case of grave necessity.

17.2 Rights of guardians over immovable properties
17.2.1 Legal guardians: Generally, established Muslim jurisprudence
does not allow a legal guardian to alienate (dispose of or pledge) a minor's
immovable properties. However, some exceptions to this rule are
recognised?:

(i)

(ii)

where the sale may fetch double the value of the property;
where the minor has no other property, and sale is necessary for

the minor's maintenance;

(iii)

where

there

are

no

other

means

of paying

deceased;

(iv)
(v)

the

debts

of the

| where there are no other means of paying legacies (under will);
where the income is less than the expenses of the property;

(vi)

| where the property is falling into decay; and
(vii)
where the property has been usurped (i.e., wrongfully
seized or
encroached upon), and the guardian fears that there
is no chance
of fair restitution.

(ii)

without necessity or advantage of the minor.
Without the prior permission of the court, such a guardian cannot:
(i)
mortgage, sell, gift away or exchange the property;

(ii)

lease any part of that property for a term exceeding five years, or
for any term extending more than one year beyond the date on
which the ward will cease to be a minor.

Any alienation in contravention of these provisions is voidable at the
instance of the minor or any person affected by such action.

18. PROCEDURAL MATTERS IN GUARDIANSHIP CASES

18.1 Jurisdiction in guardianship cases
18.1.1 Residence of minor determines territorial jurisdiction: Under
S.4(5)Gi) of the Guardians and Wards Act 1890, a decision about which
court has the jurisdiction to hear a guardianship case depends in which
district the minor for the time being ordinarily resides’.

18.1.2 Casual residence does not fall under S.4: It has been held’ that
the residence of the minor, in order to satisfy S.4 of the Guardians and
Wards Act, must be its ordinary residence and not merely a casual
residence.

Cases can arise in which a minor may be removed out of the jurisdiction
of a court by an interested party and unless this kind of residence has
continued for a sufficiently long period of time, it is obvious that it cannot

be deemed the minor's ordinary residence?.
The courts have refused to interpret S.4 to mean where the minor actually
is at the time of application, observing that this would make the law
helpless against the machinations of recalcitrant persons who do not
propose to part with the minor in favour of the appointed guardian’4.

18.1.3 Guardian's residence not necessarily minor's ordinary residence:
The courts have disagreed with the proposition that a minor is deemed to
be ordinarily residing at the place where the guardian resides, and have

18.1.4 Court
jurisdiction: Since the jurisdiction of the court is governed by the
residence of the minor and not of the guardian, the court may appoint a
person not residing within the jurisdiction of the court as a guardian®.

18.2 Appeal in guardianship cases
There is no prohibition on filing an appeal against an order passed under

the Guardians and Wards Act for custody of a minor’.

18.2.1 Right of appeal regulated by S.14 Family Courts Act: In
guardianship cases, the right of appeal is regulated by S.14 of the Family
Courts Act and not by S.47 of the Guardians and Wards Act, application
of which stands excluded by the provisions of Ss.5 & 14 of the Family
Courts Act‘.
It has been held that the expression ‘a decision given' in S.14 of the
Family Courts Act was not in any manner qualified by any such word as
‘final'. Therefore an order under S.12 of the Guardians and Wards Act,
which relates to the court's power to make an interlocutory order for the
protection of a minor and interim protection of a minor's person and
eg 3h is interpreted as “a decision given' and is appealable under
S.14(°).
18.2.2 S.47 of Guardians and Wards Act irrelevant: The obligation
imposed by S.25 of the Family Courts Act to follow the procedure
prescribed in the Guardians and Wards Act is an obligation imposed on
the Court, designed to regulate the procedure of trial before a Family

Court. It has been held® that nothing in S.25 was intended to regulate the

rights of the parties after the family courts have made their decision.
Therefore in appeal in guardianship cases, S.47 of the Guardians and
Wards Act is irrelevant to the construction of S.25.

18.2.3 Where appeal lies with District Court: District Judges are
empowered under S.25 of the Family Courts Act to transfer guardianship
cases to civil judges. It has been held that when a Civil Judge acts

taken by the District Judge under S.7 of the Guardians and Wards Act
appointing a guardian of a minor lies with the High Court under S.14 of
the Family Courts Act2.

18.3 Limitation on appeal in guardianship cases
18.3.1 Limitation is 30 days: The established limitation on appeals in
guardianship cases is 30 days from the date of judgement, as provided
for under S.14 of the Family Courts Act, and not 90 days as provided by
S.47 of the Guardians and Wards Act’4.
18.3.2 Extension of time possible: Despite the provisions mentioned
above, it is possible for an appellant to be granted an extension of time for
filing an appeal. To obtain this extension, the appellant must show that
his/her conduct throughout the period from the passing of judgement until
the filing of the appeal has been one of reasonable diligence and, that
eens reasonable diligence, he/she has not been able to file an appeal in
time’.

Section D:
General Trends in Case Law

The attitude of the superior courts towards women in custody and
guardianship cases reflects a clearly discernible shift away from the rules
of established Muslim jurisprudence. Although the courts’ primary
concern has been the welfare of the child, women have been the
beneficiary of this trend in contrast to the generally unfavourable legal
atmosphere facing women

in recent years.

Superior courts in Pakistan have, generally employed the term custody in
their judgements/orders even where they mean guardianship!. It is not
clear whether this has been done inadvertently or whether the courts in
their wisdom have accorded the status of guardian to the mother and
female relatives of a minor; further research in this area is needed.

The basic reason for favouring the mother derives from the court's
concern for ensuring the welfare of the minor above all. Rulings are then
based upon the presumption on the part of the court that the welfare of
the minor invariably lies with the mother.

the custody of his children is not a rigid and inflexible rule and must give
way where the minor's welfare demands otherwise. If the mother is a
suitable person to take charge of the child, it is quite impossible to find an
adequate substitute for her for the custody of a child of tender years; AIR

A natural or a certificated guardian may turn out to be an undesirable
person or the Court may find it not for the welfare of the minor to deliver

him into the custody of the guardian. It is, therefore, provided specifically
that although the guardian is entitled to such a custody, no order will be

made to that effect unless the Court is satisfied that it will be for welfare
of the ward. Even if there be a presumption that it is for the welfare of the
ward to deliver him into the custody of guardian, the Court will have to
weigh it against the other weighty considerations on the record. The
overriding and paramount consideration always is the welfare of the
minor. Indeed this is the sole consideration that must prevail in the final
analysis and the fact that the father is the lawful guardian of his minor

S.25--West Pakistan Family Courts Act (XXXV of 1964), S.14-Custody of
minor--Minor daughter, aged three years, given up voluntarily by mother
under an agreement between spouses--Mother of child within few days of
agreement repudiating agreement and instituted proceedings for custody
of girl on ground that said agreement was entered by her as a result of
duress and coercion--Guardian Judge impressed by fact that child was
looked after well by father and allowed mother to meet child on every date
of hearing between 9 and 12 hours--Child, when produced in Court, not
showing much attachment with her mother--Held, Guardian Judge should
have kept said factor in mind while passing order under S.12 of
Guardians and Wards Act--Since in law custody of child belonged to
mother, it was in welfare of minor that she might be restored to her
mother as it might create sentimental problem for child who was not
attached with mother--Meeting between minor child and her mother in a
court room on date of hearing could not possibly promote desired
attachment of child with her mother--Courts below while passing said

In a case where appointment of a guardian of the person of the minors or
for their custody is prayed for, the crucial question to be answered and
decided by the Court is whether the prayer if granted would be for the
welfare of the minors concerned. This decision has to be arrived at by the
Court after taking into consideration the entire facts and circumstances of
the case. This has to be the basis of an order in this respect. A decision in
this regard cannot be passed only on the consideration that as the

supervision and financing of the maintenance of the minors will remain in
the hands of the father and as such as the custody and guardianship of
the person of the minors can be given to any other female relation. The
facts available in the record have to be carefully weighed and then a
conclusion has to be reached as to how the welfare of the minors will be
best served. It is settled that an order appointing a person as guardian of
a minor of a tender age should only be passed by a Court and the custody
of the minors should be given to such a guardian only if the same is
needed for ensuring the welfare of the minors, that is to say only if the
welfare of the minors is best served thereby. A maternal grandmother's
application for appointment as guardian and for the custody of the
minors, who were in the custody of their father, was granted by the
District Judge. On appeal under S.47, Guardians and Wards Act, 1980
before High Court it was found that the maternal grandmother had no
independent means of income and had no house of her own to live in. On
the other hand the minors in the custody of the father, who was of a high
status being a high officer of the National Bank of Pakistan, were
studying in schools and were well looked after. The father had his own
house and could provide better medical and other facilities to the minors.
The decision of the District Judge, in circumstances, was held, not

Surraya Bibi vs. Abdul Rashid: 1980 CLC 785.
S.25--Custody of minor--Male child attaining age of seven years--Father
entitled to custody of such child--Reasons for laying down such principle.
The principle of Muslim law that ‘after a male child has attained the age
of seven years, his father is entitled to have his custody’ has been laid
down for the reason that up to the age of seven years a male child needs
the tender care of his mother but after he has crossed that age-limit he
deserves to be educated and groomed by his father. Needless to say that it
is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a female to watch the activities
of a grown up son and channelize his energies in the right direction
especially in the present age when juvenile delinquency is rampant and
young boys require strict supervision, day and night, both
inside as well
as outside the home. This arduous duty can be discharged
by the father
better than the mother. In this view of the matter, the
minor's association
with the appellant for about seven
years is
of ij

Constitutional jurisdiction has to show violation of any legal right vested
in her so as to make her an ‘aggrieved person'--Mere fact that petitioner

a human being on being deprived of custody of the minor was not
sufficient to entitle her to invoke Constitutional jurisdiction--Custody of

rather than go to her parents--Element of estrangement and hatred
created between the minor and the real parents could not be lost sight of

while deciding the question of welfare of the minor--Petitioner's claim to
custody of minor in preference to father was without any substance--Mere

fact that petitioner had brought up the minor since her infancy and her
deep love for her would not clothe her with a right to claim custody of
minor--Preference expressed by minor to stay with her uncle's wife was,
no doubt, relevant but not final or binding on Courts--Such preference has
to be judged with reference to the welfare of the minor--Minor being
immature, could not visualise the hazards of life and exercise sound
discretion qua her welfare--Court while exercising its parental jurisdiction

has to judge the welfare of minor in the context of circumstances of each

231

case--Where minor was practically living after the death of her uncle in a
family whose head was converted to Christianity, it was not desirable
that the minor who was impressionable age, should live in a family on
which a shadow of different religion was cast--After the death of minor's
uncle, his wife had no legal claim to retain the custody of such minor in

the child would be removed out of Pakistan was not baseless--Custody of

nature of habeas corpus was issued--Custody of child was left with the
father and mother of child was left to seek her remedy before the

Atia Waris vs. Sultan Ahmed Khan PLD 1959 Lahore 205.
On death of the husband the mother of the minor (appellant) who was

primarily a Christian but got converted to Muslim faith after marriage of
the deceased, left her parents in law but was denied custody of the minor
child who was looked after by the husband's (deceased) sister. Though the
mother was still a Muslim when she went to live with her Christian
parents, it was held that the mother was not likely to bring up the child in
the Muslim religion the child must be presumed to have the religion of the
father and it is the duty of the guardian to train and bring up the ward in
father's religion. An application under S.25 can be made by the legal or
natural guardian the dominant consideration is the welfare of the minor.
This does not however mean that the minor's personal law is of no
consequence--material moral and spiritual well being is the deciding and
governing consideration in awarding custody of the minor.

her uncle's wife was no doubt relevant but same was to be judged with
reference to the welfare of minor-Minor being under the direct influence of
uncle's wife and apparently tutored father brain washed by her had

leveled wild allegations against her own parents threatening to die rather
than go to her parents-Element of estrangement and hatred created
between the minor and the real parents could not be lost sight of while
deciding the question of welfare of the minor-Petitioner's claim to custody
of minor in preference to father was without any substance-Mere fact that
petitioner had brought up the minor since her infancy and her deep love
for her would not clothe her with a right to claim custody of minorPreference expressed by minor to stay with her uncle's wife was, no doubt,
relevant but not final or binding on Courts-Such preference has to be
judged with reference to the welfare of the minor-Minor being immature,
could not visualize the hazards of life and exercise sound discretion quo
her welfare-Court while exercising its parental jurisdiction has to judge
the welfare of minor in the context of circumstances of each case Where
minor was practically living after the death of her uncle in a family whose
head was converted to Christianity, it was not desirable that the minor
who was of impressionable age, should live in a family on which a shadow
of different religion was cast-After the death of minor's uncle, his wife had
no legal claim to retain the custody of such minor in preference to her

could not be called illegal under the Pakistan Law. Pakistan is a noncontracting state to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction nor was
there any parallel law to the Child Abduction Act of 1985 of England on
Pakistan's statute book. So even if the removal of the children from
England was improper by the father, the welfare of the minors was to be
the paramount consideration as was the previous law in England and
continued to be in Pakistan. The ultimate welfare of the minors was to be
decided by the Guardian Court. Mooted questions were not to be handled
in summary jurisdiction in a habeas corpus petition. The custody of the
minors could not be granted to the petitioner mother entitling her to
remove them from the jurisdiction of Pakistan Courts. The matter of
guardianship, was already pending in the concerned Court. The removal
of the children being improper on the part of the respondent, giving due
weight to the judgments of the Courts in England, the mother would
retain the custody but only in Pakistan subject of course to the final
determination of guardianship/custody by the Guardian Court. [p.526]

Muhammadan law--guardianship): Under Muhammadan law the mother
is disqualified from guardianship even of her minor daughter if she is
married to a man who is not related to the minor within the prohibited
degree. Where the law definitely lays down that an appointment of
certain guardian cannot be made it is not proper to discard the law even
in the interest of the minor. Rashida Begum vs. Shahab Din: PLD 1960 Lahore 1142.
Merely because the mother had married a person who was not related to
the minor within the prohibited degree would not entitle the court to
entertain an application for the appointment of guardian.
Nazeer Begum vs. Abdul Sattar: PLD 1963 Karachi 465.
Mother best entitled to custody of infants during and after dissolution of
connubial relationship. 2nd marriage with stranger after divorce does not
deprive mother of her right of hizanat if welfare of the infant demands
their remaining with mother. Father failing to claim persons of infants
within reasonable time after Hazina contracts 2nd marriage or from date
of his knowledge thereof. Presumption is, the father abandoned his right
to custody of infants. Maternal grandmother next person entitled to
custody to female minors till their attaining puberty or when mother
contracts marriage with stranger.

A natural or a certificated guardian may turn out to be an undesirable
person or the Court may find it not for the welfare of the minor to deliver
him in the custody of the guardian. It is, therefore, provided specifically
that although the guardian is entitled to such a custody, no order will be
made to that effect unless the Court is satisfied that it will be for welfare
of the ward. Even if there be a presumption that it is for the welfare of the
ward to deliver him into thé custody of guardian, the Court will have to
weigh it against the other weighty considerations on the record. The
overriding and paramount consideration always is the welfare of the
minor. Indeed this is the sole consideration that must prevail in the final
analysis and the fact that the father is the lawful guardian of his minor
children does not compel the Court to pass an order in his favour unless it
is in their welfare to do sol. The welfare of a minor means his material,
intellectual, moral and spiritual wellbeing. Harbal vs. Usman PLD 1963

S.25--Constitution of Pakistan (1973), Art.185(3). Custody of minor.
Minor's welfare. Balanced and proper upbringing. Mother's influence.
Desirability of. Custody of minor boy handed over to mother by Guardian
Judge. Appellate Court reversed order and handed over custody to father
mainly on ground that mother had remarried. Recognising mother's right
to meet her son off and on, father was directed to produce minor before
Guardian Judge once after every three months to arrange his meeting
with mother. Constitutional petition filed by mother against Appellate
Court's order failed. Leave to appeal sought on ground that meetings
allowed with mother were insufficient and could not have beneficial
influence on child for his balanced and proper upbringing. Attitude of
minor, when produced before Court and questioned so as to elicit his
responses to the wishes of his parents and his own outlook, showed that
he was being brought up and indoctrinated in a manner to develop and
exhibit stubbornness and intractability in expressing utmost revulsion
and hatred against his own mother which was something highly
unnatural for a boy of his age, likely to ruin his own personality and
growth and also likely to destroy his future utility as a citizen of a frees
country. All this happened during the period when father had been
provided maximum opportunity to bring him up, the arrangement
approved by District Judge of occasional meetings between mother and
child in office premises for a few hours, were not considered sufficient or
satisfactory for the welfare of the minor. Held: It was necessary that
intimate, sobering and mellowing influence of the mother should be made
available to the minor with a view to lend that balance and direction to

failed to pay any attention either to evidence on record or to ascertain

consider that factum of remarriage of mother had no relevance as regards

Introduction and Legisl
1. INTRODUCTION
The issue of succession and inheritance is the area where custom has
most dominated over Muslim personal law, with a negative impact on
women's rights. Although established Muslim jurisprudence gives women
a share in inheritance, customary law which denies women their share,
was the overriding basis for deciding inheritance cases right until the
fourth decade of the 20th century.

Despite centuries of Muslim rule in the region which today comprises
Pakistan, in matters of succession and inheritance local Muslim
communities did not adopt Muslim personal law which grants women a
share in inheritance. They instead followed different local customs and
usages, under which women had extremely limited or no inheritance
rights. These predominantly agricultural communities did not want
women to inherit agricultural land as on marriage control of this land
would go to another family, clan or tribe.

2. GENERAL RULES OF SUCCESSION & INHERITANCE UNDER
CUSTOMARY LAW
2.1 Agnatic succession
The general rule of customary law is agnatic succession which excludes all
females except widows and daughters.

2.2 Special property of females and limited interest
Female sine has are only allowed lifetime inter
ests

or bare
maintenance!’ and any property received by a female
as an heir or as a
gift reverts back to the male heirs of the last male
owner on termination
:f ise
the

limitedoe inter
i
est i.e., on marriage or death of the female (See Secti
on

262

(19144

Cal. 149.

2.3 No concept of ‘full owner'
Customary law does not recognise the concept “full owner', unlike
established Muslim jurisprudence which does not place any restriction on
an individual's right to dispose of his/her property.

2.4 Females have no right to challenge alienation of property
Under the customary law
alienated for a necessity
challenge such alienation
provided for in the custom,

of Punjab, ancestral property could only be
provided in the custom. A male heir could
if it was not for the necessity specifically
but a female heir had no such right.

3. OUTLINE OF LEGISLATION
One of the areas in which the British colonisers, for their own
convenience, allowed customary law to prevail was the matter of
inheritance and succession'. This was particularly detrimental to women.
Before the Shariat Acts of the 1930s, the courts decided cases under local

custom, provided that the custom was ‘not contrary to justice, equity and
good conscience, and has not been by this or any other enactment altered
or abolished, and has not been declared to be void by any competent
authority'2; personal law was applied only in the absence of a local custom
or usage.
Briefly described below are some of the statutes which are relevant to
questions of succession and inheritance.

3.1 NWFP Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act 1935
The supremacy of Muslim personal law over custom was first established
by the 1935 NWFP Shariat Act, enacted by the NWFP Legislative
Assembly on attaining provincial autonomy in the same year. It became
the first in a series of such acts legislated with the objective of replacing
customs by Muslim personal law in certain specified areas, where the
parties were Muslim. S.3 of the Act repealed S.27 of the NWFP Law and

Justice Regulation 1901 (which made first custom and then Muslim
personal law the rule of decision in family law issues), as far as Muslims
were concerned.

Section 2 of the Act laid down that Muslim personal law would be the rule
of decision in cases relating to, amongst other matters, succession
(whether testate or intestate) and special property of females, if the

However, the 1937 Act did not apply to the NWFP which already had a

of women's right to inherit agricultural land, as guaranteed by Muslim

3.3 West Punjab Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act

1948, (IX of 1948)
Enacted by the West Punjab Legislature following widespread protests
and demonstrations by hundreds of women outside the Assembly
building’, this Act made Muslim personal law applicable throughout West
Punjab even to the succession to agricultural land.
Initially the Act did not apply to testate succession, for which the Act was

later amended2.

By the same amendment S.3-A was added which terminated estates held
under wills providing for more than one legatee succeeding one after the
other to the testator's property, on the death of the legatee-in-enjoyment.
The reasoning behind this amendment was that contingent bequest is
void under established Muslim jurisprudence’. Under S.3-A the property
was to devolve on the heirs of the testator as if he had died intestate.
However, S.3-A was very loosely drafted and made no distinction between
termination of interest by death or marriage which led to many anomalies
and absurdities.

3.4 Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application (Sind Amendment)
Act 1950, (XXII of 1950)
Similarly, by this Act the Sind Legislature extended the application of
Shariat in the Province of Sind to areas not covered in the Muslim
Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937.

3.5 West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act
1962, (V of 1962)
The Act amended and consolidated the various Muslim Personal Law
Application Acts applicable to the then province of West Pakistan‘.
Section 2 of the Act reads:

Notwithstanding any custom or usage, in all
questions regarding succession (whether testate or
intestate), special property of females, betrothal,
marriage, divorce, dower, adoption, guardianship,
minority, legitimacy or bastardy, family relations,

3.6 Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961, (Vill of 1961)
Covering a wide range of Muslim personal law issues, the Ordinance also
brought major changes in the laws governing succession and inheritance.
For the first time, a law relating to inheritance was enacted which stood
in direct derogation of Hanafi law (See Section C: 3. below). There has
been no subsequent legislation on the issue.

266

1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1.1 Definition of inheritance
Inheritance is the involuntary devolution of property by which the estate
of the deceased person is transferred to the heirs as his or her successors’.

1.2 Who inherits
The laws of inheritance as given in the Qur'an and laid down in effect by
the Prophet state ‘the blood relationship is the cause of title to

succession'2.

However, an heir apparent possesses a mere possibility to inherit; an heir
apparent inherits nothing if the prepositus (ancestor) disposes of his/her

property during his/her lifetime’.

1.3 When inheritance takes place
Under the principles of Muslim jurisprudence, inheritance immediately
opens on the death of the ancestor*, and the devolution of property takes
place immediately without any other intervention®.
The right of presumptive heir, comes into existence only on the death of
the ancestor and until then s/he cannot claim any interest in the property
to which s/he would succeed®.

1.4 What is ‘heritable property’
This includes properties of all kinds and there is no distinction between
movable and immovable or ancestral and self-acquired property’.

encumbrances!. Therefore funeral expenses, debts (which includes dower
debt i.e., dower payable to the widow of the deceased) and the will, if any,
are to be satisfied before the heritable property is divided amongst the
heirs.

Sunni law does not distinguish between real and personal properties,
while Shia law observes such a distinction in the case of a childless
widow, who is not permitted to share in her husband's immovable
property.

1.5 Disinheritance (a'aq) not possible
A person cannot disinherit (a'aq) or debar his/her legal heirs from
inheritance through a testamentary disposition or otherwise, nor can a
prepositus enlarge or reduce the shares of the legal heirs through a
testamentary disposition even in extremis (at the point of death)3.

2. HEIRS UNDER HANAFI LAW
According to classical Hanafi jurists the order of inheritance is:4
(i)
Sharers (dhu fard nasabi/dhawi al-furud);
(ii)

Residuaries/agnates (asbah/asbat);

(iii) | Return to the sharers by blood if there is no residuary (radd ala
dhawi al furud nasabi);

(iv)
(v)
(vi)
(vii)

Distant Kindred (dhu rahm/dhawi al arham);
Person in whose favour paternity has been acknowledged by the
deceased (mugir lahu bil nasab);
Legatee for the whole of the property (musa lahu bi jami'
al-mal);
Bait-ul-Maal.

Shia jurists recognise the same order of inheritanc
e, but have a different
interpreta

tion of the circumstances in which each form
of inheritance
becomes operable. Equally, the Qur'anic provi
sion that children and
parents ought to succeed concurrently is
interpreted differently by the
Hanafi and Shia schools. (See 6. below on
heirs under Shia law).

Sharers are those heirs whose shares have been specified in the Holy
Qur'an'. In Sunni law, they are twelve in number, of which four are male
and eight female.

consanguine brother. And 1/6 (whether one or more) when there is only
one full sister. When there is a consanguine brother, she (or they) come
residuary.

3. RESIDUARIES (agnates)
The rights of agnates are only recognised under Hanafi law, while Shia
jurisprudence does away with the principle of agnacy.
3.1 Definition
Residuaries are those heirs who have no prescribed share but succeed
to
the ‘residue' after the claims of the sharers are satisfied.

3.2 Relationship through male
All residuaries are related to the deceased through
a male. The uterine
brother and sister are related to the deceased thro
ugh a female and are
therefore not included in the residuaries. The
residuaries, in the order of
succession can be classified into the following
four classes: .
(i)
Descendents of the deceased;
(ii)
Ascendants of the deceased;
1

270

Mannan, op. cit., Sec 76(2) p 76.

(iii)
(iv)

| Descendents of the father of the deceased;
| Descendents of the deceased's true grandfather.

3.3 Principles of succession among residuaries
(a) The nearer in degree exclude the more remote and the presence of a
prior class of residuaries in this order excludes all the later classes of
residuaries.
e.g.,

the

father

excludes

the

grandfather,

the

mother

excludes

the

grandmother and so on. This applies in both Sunni and Shia law.
(b) The descendents of the deceased get preference to the ascendents of
the deceased.
e.g.,

A son would exclude the grand parents of the deceased.

(c) Males get double portions to that of the females of parallel degree.
e.g., a son gets twice the share of a daughter.

3.4 Son is principle heir among residuaries
The son of the deceased is the principle heir among the residuaries, and is
never totally excluded. The son excludes all the other residuaries except
the daughter, who inherits along with the son an amount equal to half of
the son's share.

4. PRINCIPLE OF RETURN (radd)
The doctrine of return under Sunni law does not apply to the wife and
husband in the presence of any other heirs. However, if there are no
sharers, then both of them get by return. Under Shia law, the wife never
inherits through return.

In Shia law there is unanimity that a woman's husband is her only heir,
her complete estate will go to her husband: half as a sharer and half as

radd'. There is however some difference of opinion if the sole surviving
heir is the wife on the question of radd to her. The general view is if there
is no heir, the wife receives a quarter share of her husband's estate as a
sharer and the rest as radd?.

5. DISTANT KINDRED (uterine relations)
Under Sunni law, distant kindred are postponed in favour of sharers and
residuaries, while under Shia law, they inherit along with sharers and
residuaries.

5.1 Definition
‘Distant kindred' are those relations by blood who are neither sharers nor
residuaries!. This concept is only found in Sunni law.

5.2 Relationship through female
Distant kindred, also called uterine relations, are related to the deceased
through a female.

5.3 Principles of succession among distant kindred
(a) Distant kindred inherit only if there are no sharers or residuary2.
(b) If there is residue left after the shares of the sharers are satisfied but
there are no residuaries, then the residue reverts to the sharers in
proportion to their shares (this reversion is called ‘return' or radd)3.

(c) And if the only sharers are husband or wife and there are no
residuaries then the sharers take their full share and the rest of the
estate is divided among the distant kindred‘.

Shias, for example, give precedence to the full uncle's son where a full
uncle's son and a consanguine uncle co-exist. This is in contrast to the
general rule that preference of full blood over half blood is only necessary
when the claimants are equal in degree. This exception can be explained
by history: the Shias gave preference to Ali (the Prophet's full uncle's son)
over Abbas (his consanguine uncle).
According to Tyabji', historically the basis of both the Hanafi and Shia
systems is the customary law of pre-Islamic Arabs. Both systems alter the
customary law in accordance with Qur'anic injunctions. But the Hanafis
keep the substratum of the customary law intact and super-impose upon
it the provisions of the Qur'an, while the Shias give a wider interpretation
of the Qur'anic injunctions altering the old principles of inheritance
themselves and giving rise to an entirely new set of principles.

Noel J. Coulson? sums up the differences between the systems:

"In the contemplation of Sunnis, where the Qur'an did not
expressly reject a customary rule, it tacitly ratified it. The
result of this approach was that the Sunni law of succession
gave pride of place to the tribal heirs of the deceased. The
women to whom the Qur'an gave rights of inheritance for
the first time are entitled, in appropriate circumstances, to
j
ion
of the estate which the Qur'an allots
to them. But where a male agnate relative of the deceased
survives, this will be the limit of their entitlement. The
male agnate, however distant a relative he might be, will
step in and claim the residue of the estate; for the female,
however close a relative she might be, she does not have the
status to exclude him from succession. Hence if a Sunni
Muslim dies intestate, survived by a daughter and a distant
male agnatic cousin, the daughter will be restricted to a
portion of one-half of her father's estate, and the cousin will
inherit the remaining one-half as residuary heir.
"For the Shias however, the Qur'anic legislation was far
from being merely a series of piecemeal reforms. They
maintained that the Qur'an laid down the basic elements of
an entirely novel legal system, including a system of

Succession and
Inheritance
the pre-eminent claims of the male agnates, as such to
inheritance, they have no privileged position in the Shia
scheme of succession.
"On this basis, Shia law marshals all relatives, male and
female, agnate and otherwise, into a single comprehensive
scheme of priorities based exclusively upon the nearness of
their relationship with the deceased. Within this scheme,

any descendant of the deceased, male or female, has
absolute priority over any collateral; so that the daughter of
a deceased Shia Muslim will totally exclude his brother and
a fortiori, any more distant male agnate such as a cousin,
from succession and will inherit the whole of her father's
estate."!

Six of these sharers i.e. father, grandfather, daughter, son's daughter, full
sister and consanguine sister under certain circumstances inherit as
residuaries rather than their fixed prescribed share as sharers. For
example, the father will inherit as a residuary if there be no lineal
descendant; if there be a son, the daughter inherits as a residuary; the
full sister will inherit as a residuary if there be a full brother and father's
father.

8. ILLEGITIMACY, ADOPTION AND STEPCHILDREN
An illegitimate child is considered to be only the child of the mother.
Under Hanafi Law, an illegitimate child inherits only from its mother and
her relations and they inherit from

such child!.

Under

Shia

law,

an

has

no

rights

of inheritance2.

However, children born out of muta marriage? are under principles of
Islamic jurisprudence regarded as legitimate and inherit from their
parents* even though spouses in such marriages do not inherit from each
other. Where there is no evidence as to the term of the muta and the
cohabitation continues, the inference would, in default of evidence to the

contrary, be that the muta continued during the whole period of
cohabitation and that the children conceived during that period are
legitimate and capable of inheriting from their father. Even where the
term of the muta expires and cohabitation continues, the children
conceived during the extended term are legitimate’.
Established Muslim jurisprudence does not recognise adoption as a mode
of filation®, therefore adopted children cannot inherit from their adoptive
parents nor the parents from their adopted children. Stepchildren do not
inherit from step-parents and vice versa’.

9. INHERITING FROM A PREDECEASED ANCESTOR
9.1 Hanafi law
The expectant right of an heir apparent cannot pass by succession
to his
heir, nor can it pass by bequest to a legatee under his will8.
Therefore

under Hanafi law children of a predeceased son or daughter
inherit their parent's share from the estate of their grandp

per capita. Thus the daughter's children stand in the shoes of the
daughter, and the sister's children inherit in the right of the sister.
Shia law does not recognise the principle of representation as qualifying
the rule of exclusion. Thus children of a predeceased son or daughter can
inherit from their grandparents, only providing there is no other
residuary who is closer in degree to the prepositus: e.g., a paternal uncle
to the grandchildren (i.e., the brother of the predeceased son of the
prepositus).

Although
Independence, after 1947 the force behind the movement for replacing
customary laws with Muslim personal law weakened considerably and the
complete transition did not-take place until the early 1960s. The result
was that for a period of some four decades there was considerable
confusion over which law - customary or Muslim personal law - should
predominate. Since there were major differences between customary law
and Muslim personal law over the question of women's right to inherit,
how the courts adjudicated in this tussle between the two forms of law
had important implications for women's legal rights.

While the Act did not contain a retrospectivity clause, S.3(2) provided that
when questions relating to succession arise in court, the rule of decision
shall be the Muslim personal law whether the succession opened before or
after the Act came into force. This led to great confusion and conflicting
judgments! in the area of succession and inheritance.
In 1953 S.3(2) was amended? which provided that in questions relating to
succession, the rule of decision shall be Muslim personal law as if it had

been applicable at the time of death, thus making the Act retrospective in
effect. But in contrast, the erstwhile West Pakistan High Court held that

cases as they arise would be governed by Muslim personal law as the
legislature had never intended to reopen past transactions.

in the past. Thus a person holding an interest under custom before the
passage of the Act continued to hold it under the custom with all the
limitations custom dictated. Only when the succession reopened did the
Act became applicable.
However by making a declaration under S.3 of the Act a person could
make Muslim personal law apply to him/her immediately. (See 2.2 below
on the rights of the individual vs. the tribe).

1.1.3 1948 West Punjab Shariat Act: Under the West Punjab Shariat Act,
there was no retrospective action, so until the reopening of the succession
customary law continued to govern the inheritance of persons already
holding interests under custom.

2. SUPREMACY OF MUSLIM PERSONAL LAW OVER CUSTOM
During the early post-Independence period, case law most often focused
on which law (personal law or customary law) governed the parties rather
than controversies and innovations within the law.
The courts tended to lean in favour of personal law (and hence in favour of
women's right to inherit) unless the existence of custom was proved
beyond doubt.

2.1 Initial presumption that parties are governed by personal law
In 1951, long before custom as a rule of law was abolished, the Federal
Court! observed that in all cases an initial presumption arises that the
parties are governed by their personal law and any person setting up a

custom differing from and in derogation of personal law must establish
the basis for that custom. This laid the foundation of case law favouring
implementation of women's succession and inheritance rights under
personal law.

In subsequent decisions again upholding women's right to inherit, the
court has noted that the following of Muslim jurisprudence regarding
women's right to inherit is a matter of public policy and morality2.

2.2 The rights of the individual vs. the tribe upheld

could make
Under Section 3 of the 1937 Shariat Act, an individual
Muslim personal law apply to him/her immediately.
High
This provision was designed to offset a judgment of the Lahore

Court! wherein it was held that it was not open to an individual, whose
family or tribe had for generations followed custom, to suddenly give up
the custom to the detriment of those who would be entitled to benefit from
it under the law they were subject to, by merely making a declaration to
that effect.

2.3 Muslim personal law applied to testate succession
Under the 1937 Shariat Act, questions relating to testate succession
(where the deceased has made and left a clear will) were excepted by
inference as the Act was made applicable only to intestate succession
(where the deceased left no will). Similarly, the 1948 West Punjab Shariat
Act did not initially apply to testate succession. It was however later
amended in 1951(2).

2.4 Termination of wil!s providing for more than one legatee
On the basis of the argument that a contingent bequest is void under
Muslim jurisprudence’, the 1948 West Punjab Shariat Act was amended
in 1951, adding S.3-A which terminated estates held under wills
providing for more than one legatee succeeding one after the other to the
testator's property. Following the amendment, the property was to
devolve on the heirs of the testator as if he had died intestate.
S.4 of the 1962 West Pakistan Shariat Act terminates wills providing for
more than one legatee, upon the death of the legatee in enjoyment while
oO provides for the devolution of property of estates terminated under

2.5 Limited interest
The 1935 NWFP Shariat Act was silent about limited estates held
by
Muslim females*. The Judicial Commissioner held® that such an
interest

the Act and
heirs in existence at the time of the termination of
the estate were
entitled to succeed. In 1950 8.4 was added® to the Act which

on termination of a limited interest the property would devolve on those
entitled to inherit at the time of the last full owner. So limited interest
was recognized and protected under the Act, first through a judicial
decision and later through a legislative amendment.

Although the 1948 West Punjab Shariat Act made Muslim personal law
applicable to succession to agricultural land, S.3 excepted limited estates
held by Muslim females under custom till the termination of the estate.

2.5.1 Proviso nullifies Muslim personal law: Section 2 of the 1962 West
Pakistan Shariat Act made Muslim personal law the rule of decision in
questions relating to the special property of females (See Section A above:
3.5).
But while S.3 of the Act terminated ‘life estates' held under customary
law, strangely a proviso to the same Section saved limited estates held
under any enactment repealed by this Act. Thus for all practical purposes
the proviso nullified the substantive provisions of S.3.

2.5.2 Women holding life estates become full owners: S.5 provided for
the devolution of property of estates terminated under Sections 3 and 4 of
the Act. The effect of termination of life estates was that all the females
holding immovable property under such estates became full owners! as
the inheritance reopened on the cessation of such interests.

3. SUCCESSION OF CHILDREN OF PREDECEASED CHILD (S.4
MFLO)
The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 (MFLO) radically departed
from the Hanafi law of inheritance by granting the right of succession to
the children of a predeceased child
Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance 1961 reads:

In the event of the death of any son or daughter of
the prepositus before the opening of succession, the
children of such son or daughter, if any living at the
time the succession opens, shall per stirpes receive a
share equivalent to the share which such son or
daughter as the case may be, would have received, if
alive.

Succession and
Inheritance
3.1 MFLO readily followed

The MFLO has been readily followed despite several observations
courts that it was a departure from the accepted Muslim Law

by
of

inheritance’.

3.2 Courts take literal view of Section 4 of MFLO
3.2.1 Benefit not extended to spouse of predeceased child: In numerous
cases the courts have refused to extend the benefit of per stirpes share to
the wife or husband of the predeceased child as they did not come with in
the purview of S.4 of the MFLO2.

3.2.2 Benefit not extended to non-Pakistanis: The courts have refused to
extend the benefit of S.4 of the MFLO to a British Muslim as the
provision was a departure from established Muslim jurisprudence and
was applicable only to Muslims who were citizens of Pakistan®.

3.2.3 Benefit extends to female children of predeceased: In a case
reaching the Peshawar High Court‘ it was held that the female child of a
predeceased father is entitled to inherit the entire estate that the father
would have inherited if alive and not the share to which she would have
been entitled under the principles of Muslim jurisprudence. A daughter
may also inherit from a predeceased mother®.

3.3 Controversy surrounding ‘Islamic' nature of Section 4
Case law on S.4 of the MFLO reflects the controversy regarding this
provision of the law in legal as well as religious circles where it has been
argued that it contravenes a clear Qur'anic injunction.

During the Martial Law of 1977 when the so-called process of
Islamisation was initiated, in the famous case of Farishta vs. Federation
of Pakistan® it was held that in order to be entitled to inherit under the
principles of Muslim jurisprudence, a person must be alive, therefore
S.4
of the MFLO was against the injunctions of Islam and liable
to be
repealed.

Interestingly however, the court nevertheless felt
inclined that the
children of a predeceased child should inherit the
parent's share and went
on to suggest various means for relieving the
distress of the children of
predeceased sons or daughters under Musl
im jurisprudence.

4. DIVORCE AND INHERITANCE
4.1 Limited legal capacity during marz ul maut
In Muslim jurisprudence, the legal capacity of a person suffering from
marz ul maut is restricted in matters such as making gifts, pronouncing
divorce upon his wife, making acknowledgments of debts etc., primarily to
protect the interests of prospective heirs. Marz ul maut is defined as any
malady which induces an apprehension of death in the person suffering
from it and which eventually does result in death’.

4.2 Marz ul maut and divorced wife's right to inherit
The practice of pronouncing divorce on the wife during the husband's
terminal illness is usually to prevent the wife from getting her share in
the husband's property. Muslim jurisprudence provides that although
mutual rights of inheritance between husband and wife cease as soon as
the divorce becomes irrevocable, if divorce was pronounced during the
husband's death illness the wife's right to inherit continues until the
expiry of her iddat, unless she was repudiated at her own request?.

4.3 Courts uphold divorced wife's right to inheritance during iddat
In the few reported cases of this nature, the courts have consistently held
that if a person suffering from a terminal illness (marz ul maut) divorces
his wife, she is not deprived of her right of inheritance if the person dies
during the 90-day period of iddat that should follow the divorce’. For
example, a woman divorced three days before her husband's death
nevertheless retains her right to inherit from her ex-husband as
inheritance opens immediately upon death, whereas talaq is effective only
after the expiry of 90 days4. This trend is a reiteration of established
Muslim jurisprudence on the subject and is a welcome step towards the
protection of women's rights.

5. RELINQUISHMENT AND GIFT DEEDS
5.1 Duty of courts to protect women's right of inheritance

Succession and
Inheritance
Islam affords women the best protection of their right of inheritance, and
the scope of such rights was so large and their trust so strong that it was
the duty of the court to protect them!.

5.2 Gift deeds struck down
The courts have shown themselves aware of the pressure under which
women relinquish their property rights and have upheld the Contract Act
(IX of 1872) S.25 which declares void all those agreements which are not
in writing, registered and made out of natural love and affection between
the parties. Thus agreements which do not fulfill these conditions are
regarded as void?.

The Supreme Court’ has struck down a gift deed, allegedly executed by a
man without male issue in favor of his male relatives (challenged by the
alleged donor himself), on the ground that the beneficiaries failed to
explain why the alleged donor could have made the gift, depriving his own
three daughters. The court observed that this would have run counter to
the principles regarding the protection of the interests of female relatives
in Islam.

5.3 Relinquishment deeds struck down
In a Karachi High Court‘ case, the court refused to accept such a
relinquishment deed executed by a female living under the roof of male
relatives observing that Muslim jurisprudence affords special protection
to Muslim females and that relinquishment deeds from inheritance
executed by a female while she was living under the roof of her father,
brother, husband or any other male relative had no value whatsoever and
she could not be deprived of her property on the basis of such a deed.

Analysis of
Case Law
6.2 Courts reject plea of money spent on female heir's behalf
The Supreme Court! has held that a sister could not be deprived of her
share in inheritance on the plea that money had been spent by her
brothers on her behalf.

6.3 Brothers have no right to claim adverse possession or ouster
Where brothers have claimed ‘ouster' of their sister from her inherited
property on the plea of adverse possession, the Supreme Court in a
landmark judgement? held that ‘brothers were required by law to protect
the property rights of their sister if they came into possession of the land
in any capacity’. However, the court further observed that the brothers
were merely custodians of the property and the sister could lay claim
whenever she desired and without any limitation on time. One who is
enjoined with the protection of the other's property cannot lay claim
adverse to the interests and rights of that other one who owns it. The
sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) enjoin menfolk to protect the
property rights of womenfolk and therefore brothers could not claim
adverse possession against their sister, much less ouster’.

This judgement reflects the general assumption by the courts that men
are protectors over women (See Section D below: General Trends in Case
Law).

6.4 Succession of residuaries rejected in female's favour
Applying the principle of ‘justice, equity and good conscience’, the courts
have awarded the entire property to a widow and her daughters’.

In this case, one

Dara

killed his nephews

in the hope that, under

established Muslim jurisprudence, his sons (as the nearest male agnates
of his brother) would succeed to five twenty-fourths of the estate, whereas
the widow and two daughters of the prepositus would inherit one-eighth
and two-thirds respectively. The court refused to allow the nephews their
share and awarded the entire property to the women.

7. FEMALE'S RIGHT TO INHERIT AGRICULTURAL LAND
7.1 Legislation upholds women's right
The NWFP Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1935 was
far reaching in that it applied to agricultural land as well. In contrast,
‘questions relating to agricultural land' were expressly excepted from the

purview of the 1937 Shariat Act which applied to the whole of India
(except the NWFP as it already had its own legislation on the issue).
Following considerable pressure from women inside and outside the West
Punjab Legislature, the 1948 West Punjab Shariat Act made Muslim
personal law applicable even to the succession to agricultural land.
Similarly, by the 1950 Sind Shariat Act, the Sind Legislature amended
the 1937 Shariat Act in its application to the Province of Sind so as to
extent Shariat even to questions relating to agricultural land’.

7.2 Shia daughter entitled to entire agricultural land left by father
The courts have upheld a daughter's right to inherit her Shia father's
entire estate to the exclusion of her issueless stepmother and her father's
brother’.

Pakistani case law on inheritance and succession rights of
encouraging. From 1947 to date where a woman has
courts for the protection of her right to inherit, she has
positive response.

However in comparison to other areas of family law covered in
handbook, the number of cases regarding women's inheritance
succession rights is extremely low. Is this because there are very
disputes in this field due to strict compliance with the law? Or is it

this
and
few
that

because of the countless obstacles and inhibitions women face, such cases

rarely make it to court? Or is the pressure from both family and society to
forego one's inheritance so compelling that few women dream of raising
an inheritance dispute?

As in other areas of family law, the superior courts reflect the views of
society regarding women's succession and inheritance rights.

1. Assumption that women need protection’
The tone of most judgments is one of condescension, giving the
appearance that women need to be protected, not because they have
rights as equal citizens of the state but because they are seen as the
weaker and more disadvantaged section of society. It is presumed that
women are not ‘adult' and are incapable of taking important decisions,
that they will always be deceived and tricked out of their possessions by
scheming men; hence the constant need for male protection.

An example is the judgements rejecting relinquishment deeds executed by
women signing away their inheritance to male relatives.
In the

required and the courts' sensitivity to the problem is welcome. But in the

women's inheritance rights; women run the risk of being permanently

marginalised in matters relating to property.

2 Isolated instances where justice, equity and good conscience
used
n
There have been judgements where the guiding force behind the decisio
has been ‘justice, equity and good conscience’ leading to a departure from

regarding
certain principles of established Muslim jurisprudence
inheritance. The classic example is Beguman vs. Saroo! (See Section C
above: 6.4).

3. Assault on laws and judgements favourable to women
With the era of ‘Islamisation' came the assault on progressive laws such

as the MFLO and judgments especially favourable to women on the basis
of Islamic' justice.

Chief Justice Zullah's judgments are noteworthy in this regard and
representative of the ongoing conflict. For instance, in one case* the
question was whether adverse entry and non-participation in the profits
of the property would not amount to an ouster of co-sharer. The issue had
already been adequately dealt with in a well-known earlier case? and it
was decided there that female heirs are deemed to be in possession of
their share of estate by succession as co-heirs even though their names
were not entered in revenue records.

But the court's judgment consisted of a comparative discussion of various
religious systems
and the superiority that established
Muslim

jurisprudence enjoyed over them. In arriving at his decision, Chief Justice
Zullah made a highly innovative interpretation of Surah Al-Nissa (4),
Verse 34(4) of the Qur'an to prove that there was non-discrimination in
Islam. This verse has to date been considered the main verse creating and
establishing male superiority since it is translated and interpreted as
clearly stating that men are the providers and maintainers of women. The
judgment says that for the very reason that they are providers' and

1. INTRODUCTION
Wherever possible procedural matters have been placed in their relevant
topic section in this Handbook. However there are a number of procedural
questions which are not specific to a particular topic in family disputes,
but which relate to the entire body of family law, particularly to the
Family Courts, their jurisdiction and the question of appeal.

Also, family disputes often involve a combination of elements from various
aspects of family law and their separate elements cannot be taken in
isolation from each other. For example, a suit for maintenance is
countered by a suit for restitution of conjugal rights; a suit for jactitation
of marriage forms part of a woman's battle to secure her rightful
inheritance from a deceased husband, etc.

This has been recognised in the statute law, where according to S.5 of the
West Pakistan Family Court Act 1964, the family courts have the
jurisdiction to entertain, hear and adjudicate upon the following matters:

dissolution of marriage;
dower;
maintenance;

restitution of conjugal rights

custody of children;
guardianship

jactitation of marriage’.

Section B:

Analysis of Case Law
1. NATURE AND JURISDICTION OF FAMILY COURTS
1.1 The nature of Family Courts
The provisions of the Family Courts Act make it clear that the intention
of the law is to set up courts and entrust matters to them in their capacity
as courts and not as persona designata. A Family Court is, therefore, a
court of law as contemplated in Article 102 read with Article 242 of the
Constitution of 1962(").

1.2 Family Court is a civil court
Though the provisions of the CPC are excluded under S.17 of the Family
Courts Act from applying to proceedings before the Family Courts, yet
that would not in any way change the character of the Family Court as a
civil court?.
Where the same Judge is exercising the powers of both the Family Court
and the Civil Court, the plaint filed before him by the Civil Court should
have been treated as one filed in the Family Court and he should have

proceeded with the suit accordingly’.

1.3 Jurisdiction of Family Court
A Judge of the Family Court has no jurisdiction to entertain, hear and
adjudicate or take cognizance of any offence other than those related with

matters specified in Schedule 5 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (See
Section A, Introduction). Such offences have to be tried by courts
constituted under the Criminal Procedure Code and not by Family
Courts’.

Suits relating to family matters, such as recovery of dower,
are not
maintainable before the civil courts and petitioners have
been asked to
seek remedy from the F amily Court°.

1.4 Pecuniary jurisdiction of Family Courts
Family Courts have unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction. They are not
ordinary courts whose jurisdiction is limited to Rs 25,000 by the West
Pakistan Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962(").

1.5 Territorial jurisdiction of Family Courts
Rule 6 of the Rules framed under this Act determines the territorial
jurisdiction of the Court. It provides that the “Court which shall have
jurisdiction to try a suit will be that within the local limits of which (a)
the cause of action wholly or in part has arisen, or (b) where the parties
reside or last resided together: provided that in suits for dissolution of
marriage or dower, the Court within the local limits of which the wife
ordinarily resides shall also have jurisdiction.' This has mitigated the
problems facing a wife when she leaves her husband's place and moves to
another place, village or city as a consequence of a dispute?.
In the matter of the custody of a minor, an application is maintainable at
a place where the cause of action has arisen. Such an application can also
be moved in a place where the minor ordinarily resides®.

1.6 Execution of money decree
A Family Court is competent to execute its decree as arrears of land
revenue and can issue warrants of arrest. The husband's refusal to pay
the decreed amount can disentitle him to any assistance in writ
jurisdiction, i.e. his is disentitled to take a writ in appeal to the high
court’,

1.7 Residence of woman determines jurisdiction
Where there is more than one family suit between the same parties, the
courts generally attempt to combine the suits in order to avoid further
delay and inconvenience to the parties.
Equally, the courts tend to consider the woman's convenience, and
transfer cases to the jurisdiction of the court in her area of residence.

It is a settled principle that the best place for adjudication of a family suit
is the one where the wife has filed the suit, especially when the wife has
instituted her suit at a place where the marriage took place and which is
her place of permanent residence?.

2. PROCEDURE IN FAMILY COURTS
2.1 Applicability of Civil Procedure Code 1908, & Evidence Act
1872
The provisions of the Evidence Act of 1872 and the Civil Procedure Code
of 1908 do not apply to proceedings before the Family Court, except Ss.10
and 11 of the CPC which read:

"Section 10: No Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the
matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously
instituted suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom
they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where such suit

is pending in the same or any other Court in Pakistan having jurisdiction
to grant the relief claimed, or in any Court beyond the limits of Pakistan
established or continued by the Central Government and having like

jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court.

"Section 11: No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter
directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in
issue in a former suit between the same parties, or between parties under
whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a
Court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such
issue

KLR 1992 CC 570

The Family Courts have been given a real inquisitional jurisdiction by the
introduction of a special procedure, including an obligatory effort to
discover the possibilities of an amicable settlement}.

2.1.1 Execution of decree for conjugal rights: It has been held2 that since
a family court has been given the discretion as to how it will execute a
decree for conjugal rights, it would not be violating the law by using
provisions of the CPC in execution.
The argument runs that the Family Courts Act contains no special
provisions specifying the manner or mode of execution of a decree for
restitution of conjugal rights. S.13(4) provides in general terms that a
decree passed by a Family Court is to be executed either by the court
which had passed the decree or by any other civil court as directed by a
District Judge through the granting of a special or general order. Since
the power to execute the decree has been conferred on a family court but
no procedure has been laid out for its execution, the court can follow the
procedure contained in the CPC.

2.2 Family Court to regulate own proceedings
Since the Family Courts Act of 1964 does not make provision for every
conceivable eventuality and unforeseen circumstance, the family courts
are expected to regulate their own proceedings‘.

2.3 Every procedure is permissible unless clearly prohibited
The clear intention of the law is to ensure that the family courts have full
powers to take an active role in resolving family disputes.
Thus, a number of rulings? have held that the family courts should
proceed on the premises that every procedure is permissible unless a clear
prohibition is found against it in law. The court cannot and should not sit
like a distant spectator to witness a legal battle being fought before it
between two adversaries. It should, and must, when circumstances so
demand, exercise its own powers to prevent the course of justice being
deflected from its true path. In family disputes, this is all the more
necessary, and maybe this was the reason for enacting a special statute
giving the family courts exclusive jurisdiction to decide specified family
disputes.

2.5 Determining court fees
Details of court fees have been provided in Section C: Charts of Procedure
in Family Cases.

3. APPEAL IN FAMILY DISPUTES
3.1 Forum for appeal
According to S.14 of the Family Courts Act 1964, in instances where a
family court is presided over by a District Judge, appeal lies with the
High Court; in any other case, appeal lies with the District Court, which
according to S.2(21) of the West Pakistan General Clauses Act and S.2(4)
of the CPC means the principal Civil Court of original civil jurisdiction of

a district®.

Once a Civil Judge has been notified as a Family Judge, the amount of
money involved in the judge's decree is irrelevant to determining the

forum of appeal‘.

3.2 Appeal court required to provide reasons for reversing trial
court decree
Where the appellate court reverses the trial court's decree, it not only has

to take into account the entire evidence, but also has to take notice of the
reasons for taking a contrary view°.

3.3 Every interlocutory order of Family Court not appeal able
Every interlocutory order (every order given in the process of a decree) of
a Family Court is not appealable. The word “decision' as used in S.14 of
the Family Courts Act only covers orders that are passed under some
provision of the Act, thus implying final or temporary determination of a
matter which forms part of an issue involved in a particular case. A
condition order by the trial court cannot be termed a “decision' for the
purposes of S.14 and thus is not appealable'.

3.4 Court fees on appeal
3.4.1

No

fee for suits

involving

matters

not exceeding

Rs

25,000/-:

Where the value of the subject matter or of the relief claimed in the suit
does not exceed Rs 25,000/-, there is no court fee on appeal. Wherever the
amount involved is more than that, a court fee is payable.
The relevant details regarding court fees on appeal are found in Punjab
Notification No. 353-80/248-St-1 dated 4.2.1980, and Sindh Ordinance 13
of 1978 and NWFO Ordinance 14 of 1978. It has been held? that these
clearly show that court fee is remitted inter alia on all civil and revenue
suits at all stages in all courts, provided the value of the subject matter or
of the relief claimed in the suit does not exceed Rs 25,000/-. The words
“civil suits' and “in all courts' clearly show that the remission is intended
to cover documents filed in regular suits before the normal civil court, and
also documents filed in other suits provided under special laws where
such laws provide for the institution of suits through representation of
plaints and where such suits are triable by civil courts.
3.4.2 When court fee on appeal is deficient: Where the court fee paid on
an appeal is too little, the High Court can in constitutional jurisdiction
direct that the judgement and decree in appeal will not take effect until
the deficient amount is made up’.

3.5 No second appeal
The words ‘decision' and ‘decree' under in S.14(1) of the West Pakistan

Family Courts Act refer to the original decision or decree given by a court

of first instance and not by an appellate court. The purpose of the statute

on has
is to shorten the proceedings; therefore no second appeal or revisi

been provided'.

3.6 No revision against family matters

Even if the Family Court is regarded as a court subordinate to the High
Court, $.17 of the Family Courts Act excludes the orders of the family
courts from the operation of Section 115 CPC. Thus S.115 of the CPC is
not available for obtaining revision of an order passed by the family
courts.

An order passed under the Act by a Family Court presided over by a Civil
Judge or by an appellate court presided over by a District Judge cannot be
revised under S.115 CPC%.

3.7 Constitutional jurisdiction against family matters
3.7.1 Where High Court refuses to interfere: It has been held* that the
High Court cannot assume the role of a Court of appeal for the purpose of
arriving at its own conclusions both on facts and law after reappraisal of
the evidence brought before the trial court. It is the function of the courts,
which are invested with exclusive jurisdiction under the Family Courts
Act, which must first be allowed to exercise their powers and jurisdiction
in accordance with law, subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High
Court in constitutional jurisdiction®.
The High Court will not interfere with the judgement and decree passed
by a court of competent jurisdiction because it is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Judge Family Court to believe or disbelieve the
evidence; and the Judge has given reasons in support of his conclusions®.
The High Court will not interfere where the order of the appellate court
was neither illegal nor without jurisdiction so as to warrant interference
in writ jurisdiction’.

Thus a finding of fact recorded by a District Judge cannot be interfered
with in writ jurisdiction especially when it had not been shown to be

based on a misreading of evidence!.

A constitutional petition cannot be used to challenge an order in appeal on
the ground that the evidence in the case has not been properly

appreciated.

3.7.2 Where High Court will interefere: An appellate judgement based on
misreading of evidence as well as misconception about the true legal
position was set aside in writ jurisdiction as not sustainable’.
There is also no bar to writ petitions where the appellate court has not
exercised appellate jurisidiction in so far as it has not considered the plea
raised by the appellant that she was entitled to dissolution of marriage on
the ground of khula. In one such case4, the High Court set aside the order
dismissing the appeal in writ jurisdiction and directed the appellate court
to hear the appeal afresh and to decide the plea.
